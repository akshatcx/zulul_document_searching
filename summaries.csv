"Abstract. We conduct to our knowledge a first measure- ment study of commercial mmWave 5G performance on smartphones by closely examining 5G networks in two U.S. cities. We conduct extensive field tests on 5G performance under diverse conditions including different obstruction lev- els, phone-tower distances, and device orientations. We systematically analyze the handoff mechanisms in 5G and their impact on network performance. We also study app performance (web browsing and HTTP download) over 5G, and how Internet server selection affects the end-to-end per- formance for 5G users. Our experiments consume 10 TB of 5G data, conducted when 5G just made its debut in April 2019. These experiments provide a “baseline” for studying how 5G performance evolves, and identify key research di- rections on improving 5G users’ experience in a cross-layer manner."
"Abstract—Exploiting multi-antenna technologies for robust beamsteering to overcome the effects of blockage and beam misalignment is the key to providing seamless multi-Gbps connectivity in 5G-and-beyond mm-wave networks. In this paper, we present the first large-scale outdoor mm-wave measurement study using a phased antenna array in a typical European town. We systematically collect fine-grained 3D angle-of-arrival and angleof-departure data, totaling over 50,000 received signal strength measurements. We study the impact of phased antenna arrays in terms of number of link opportunities, achievable data rate and robustness under small-scale mobility, and compare this against reference horn antenna measurements. Our results show a limited number of 2–4 link opportunities per receiver location, indicating that the mm-wave multipath richness in a European town is surprisingly similar to that of dense urban metropolises. The results for the phased antenna array reveal that significant losses in estimated data rate occur for beam misalignments in the order of the half-power beamwidth, with significant and irregular variations for larger misalignments. By contrast, the loss for the horn antenna is monotonically increasing with the misalignment. Our results strongly suggest that the effect of non-ideal phased antenna arrays must be explicitly considered in the design of agile beamsteering algorithms. Index Terms—Millimeter wave, phased antenna array, beam misalignment, multipath propagation, urban deployments."
"Mental well-being technologies possess many qualities that give them the potential to help people receive assessment and treatment who may otherwise not receive help due to fear of stigma or lack of resources. The combination of advances in sensors, microcontrollers and machine learning is leading to the emergence of dedicated tangible interfaces to monitor and promote positive mental well-being. However, there are key technical, ergonomic and aesthetic challenges to be overcome in order to make these interfaces effective and respond to users’ needs. In this paper, the barriers to develop mental well-being tangible interfaces are discussed by identifying and examining the recent technological challenges machine learning, sensors, microcontrollers and batteries create.

"This study attempts to understand the use of Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) in practice to obtain insights to develop design interventions that bring the CPGs into the Internet of Things. Our ultimate aim is to equip CPGs with a layer of smartness so that CPGs could collect information about their use and provide extra services and functionalities. With a practice perspective we developed an assemblage of methods to analyze and represent how people use CPGs. We chose cooking as our practice case and use an autoethnographic data sample to demonstrate the application of our methods. Despite the early stage of our study, our methods provide ways to get an understanding of how CPGs are used in practice and an opening to establish opportunities for design interventions"
"Abstract—In this paper we address the problem of resource allocation for alarm traffic in industrial Internet of Things networks using massive MIMO. We formulate the general problem of how to allocate pilot signals to alarm traffic such that delivery is guaranteed, while also minimising the number of pilots reserved for alarms, thus maximising the channel resources available for other traffic, such as industrial control traffic. We present an algorithm that fulfils these requirements, and evaluate its performance both analytically and through a simulation study. For realistic alarm traffic characteristics, on average our algorithm can deliver alarms within two time slots (of duration equal to the 5G transmission time interval) using fewer than 1.5 pilots per slot, and even in the worst case it uses around 3.5 pilots in any given slot, with delivery guaranteed in an average of approximately four slots. Index Terms—Industrial IoT; massive MIMO, 5G; URLLC; pilot allocation; collision tree"
