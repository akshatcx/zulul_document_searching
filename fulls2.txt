figure 1 shows different types challenges associated design development tangible interfaces mental wellbeing technical challenges advancements cpus microcontrollers sensors resulted smaller computationally powerful accurate devices still many challenges overcome developing mental well-being tangible interfaces one significant issues currently faced physical size devices users prioritise look feel tangible interfaces mental well-being tangible interfaces must remain small same time embed required sensors microcontroller battery small powerful processors available increase cost devices considerably sensor accuracy remains challenge infer mental well-being highly accurate sensors vital recent advancements resulted shelf physiological sensors measuring heart rate variability hrv electrodermal activity eda detect stress similar accuracy clinical grade sensors paired machine learning classifiers however machine learning classifiers must first trained vast amounts accurate real-world labelled data can difficult obtain machine learning provides clear benefits requires computationally powerful devices run ideally classification models would run on-device would reduce latency increase privacy user data would never transmitted device new devices raspberry pi zero capable running simple classification models on-device however limited ram larger size still create challenges alternatively small microcontrollers arduino nano could utilised only allow collection data one option maintain small footprint arduino nano still utilise machine learning combine bluetooth low energy transmit data mobile application can run classification model machine learning could also allow provision personalised mental well-being inference provides solution one challenging aspects

data required each individual experiencing different states well-being novel solution development tangible interfaces containing necessary sensors addition embedded techniques self-label allowing collection large amounts realworld labelled data can then used accurately train machine learning models battery life increasing challenge advancements the development more computationally powerful processors additional sensors have outpaced advancements batteries resulting shortened battery life li-po batteries most suitable mental well-being tangible interfaces they physically small rechargeable unlike 9v alkaline batteries commonly used within the iot developing tangible interfaces using arduino nanos numerous physiological environmental sensors li-po batteries 500mah 1200mah provided an average battery life 5 10 hours sufficient the tangible interfaces the machine learning classifiers run on-device would reduce battery life significantly many the challenges concern the detection mental well-being tangible interfaces also improve well-being additional challenges overcome the primary challenge the use different feedback mechanisms including auditory visual haptic feedback will need examined confirm capability reliably improve mental well-being the general population user-orientated challenges addition the technical challenges exist also many new user-oriented challenges need addressed many are unique tangible interfaces wellbeing machine learning been shown provide many advantages used infer mental well-being accurately trained large amount user data first required making user engagement one the largest challenges facing the accuracy tangible interfaces are numerous reasons user engagement often low including digital competence many users experience mental health challenges may possess high digital competence however research shows tangible interfaces require high digital competence engaging result any individual able use devices stigma another issue could reduce user engagement traditionally much stigma around mental health the diagnostic tools used combat stigma the tangible interfaces designed appear inconspicuous one method accomplish embedding the sensors pre-existing familiar devices toys children making the devices inconspicuous they are immediately more familiar approachable people use less stigmatised given the stigma associated mental health security top concern anyone developing using tangible interfaces mental well-being many users consider mental health data highly personal would not want shared any third parties the sensitive nature the data on-device processing would be ideal the data remains local secure although may not always be possible additional computational power may be required legislation could help alleviate concerns the general data protection regulation gdpr the eu eea have attempted give control citizens personal data ensuring they can access data understand being processed gdpr may help gain people ’ trust mental well-being tangible interfaces allows people assess their personal data is stored processed developing devices be used people mental well-being challenges is essential involve end users the development process tangible interfaces mental well-being explored focus groups school students severe profound complex learning physical disabilities nottingham uk these focus groups highlighted additional challenges must be addressed mainstream adoption the cost the devices key concern they must be affordable the school individuals consider purchasing can be addressed using cheap off the shelf sensors microcontrollers durability another concern raised as children often drop break technological devices address this concern tangible interfaces specifically designed children toys have been developed these provide additional protection the electronic components their durability remains challenge students within the school also face fine gross motor control issues making many technological solutions as mobile apps challenging use designing tangible interfaces be easy grip durable improve the accessibility such technology co-designing the tangible interfaces is also vital ensure acceptance high usability designing people cognitive impairments is vital they are often overlooked as “ if a mental health problem presents … it is more likely be attributed their learning disability diagnostic overshadowing classed as challenging behaviour ” co-designing people cognitive impairments present additional challenges such as legality issues regarding informed consent the impact participation as some participants may find it challenging confronted their limitations however many these challenges can be overcome using method stories which describe methods work reality instead how they ought work theory many the user-oriented challenges are more difficult overcome the technological challenges user adoption engagement should be prioritised co-design workshops ensure the feasibility acceptance mental well-being tangible interfaces conclusion the emergence mental well-being tangible interfaces advancements sensors machine learning microcontrollers suggest a new era technological mental well-being tools yet many challenges remain this paper pointed a number research challenges warrant investigation many these challenges are technological including the physical size many off-the-shelf sensors microcontrollers the battery life devices the processing power required on-device machine learning current advancements these challenges should become less problematic are also many user-orientated challenges ranging difficulties engaging users co-design challenges ensuring data privacy while these challenges remain it is imperative to involve end users at all stages the design development mental well-being tangible interfaces to ensure effective interfaces are developed overall mental well-being tangible interfaces present a great opportunity individuals to automatically monitor improve their well-being many challenges must be overcome by researchers to make this a reality references lulwah al-barrak eiman kanjo
