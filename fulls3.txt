could used more than one time which particularly true non-perishable cpgs network visualizations the size a node represents the number interactions it other items the edges represent interactions nodes see figure 2 the proximity nodes ’ centers inversely correlates the number interactions the visualization gives a sense the way items used a given cooking session the left side the spices form a cluster connects food lentils squash could infer those spices were used season food nodes have a prominent size they connected a large number items palette a central node could infer it had a central role the cooking process categorization specific interactions found a total 9 interactions the cooking session those 3 represent trouble interactions 6 opportunity interactions table 4 next provide a detailed description a digital intervention idea one trouble one opportunity interactions fixing meal an opportunity this refers all actions related improving the taste food examples include seasoning the food add extra ingredients changing the cooking method intervention idea cpgs could provide support users how season food a person is cooking a meal cpgs could indicate they go well a food unorthodox action a trouble actions which the person makes an unorthodox use cpgs utensils using a knife get a portion mayonnaise a jar is an example this intervention idea cpgs could take advantage the hidden unorthodox use their products cpgs could re-designed better adapt the ways people use finding design opportunities smartness consumer packaged goods figure 2 network visualization represents the interactions cpgs utensils a cooking session the classification the interactions could represent areas design opportunities could give designers researcher situations worth explore discussion proposed methods suggest it is possible get an understanding how cpgs used focusing different perspectives granularity cpgs usages understanding could inspire different interventions ranging general identifying available cpgs the kitchen finding design opportunities smartness consumer packaged goods specific revealing the formation clusters cpgs an example an intervention could the development a system that recommends recipe meals based the available cpgs home this could accomplish equipping cpgs low cost sensors that allows them communicate a system home indicate their

although used a data sample a way demonstrate results have not applied our methods a large number people now the potential our methods are only speculations the results the applications our methods may vary a large number people with a longer implementation we could expect instance our way counting the interactions between cpgs utensils to be time consuming that may restrict the application a large number people to summarize the methods proposed this paper appear to represent a fairly acceptable manner how cpgs are used provide insights design interventions as with any attempt to represent the real world those methods may focus as well as exclude information we may argue for the implementation the methods a large number of people our immediate next steps involve both the inclusion of more participants and working towards refining our analysis methods acknowledgments this work was supported the horizon centre for doctoral training the university of nottingham ukri grant
