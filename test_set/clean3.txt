Useroriented challenges that face the development of mental wellbeing technologies are then considered ranging from user engagement during codesign and trials to ethical and privacy concerns  KEYWORDS Affective computing  Pervasive computing  Artificial intelligence  IoT  Tangible interfaces INTRODUCTION The capabilities and possibilities for tangible interfaces to have a positive impact on mental wellbeing are expanding rapidly  The increasing emergence of IoT and computationallypowerful devices is opening up new opportunities for delivering mental wellbeing monitoring in a more automated and accessible manner  The World Health Organisation defines mobile health  mHealth  as  the use of mobile and wireless technologies to support the achievement of health objectives    Tangible interfaces go beyond mobile apps as they enable a person to interact with digital information through the physical environment  Mental wellbeing tangible interfaces possess many qualities including the ability to diagnose  promote positive mental wellbeing  collect and monitor wellbeing data remotely and transform wellbeing  Tangible and embodied interaction improves accessibility  reduces stigma and reduces costs due to reduced needs for medical assistance  although there are many obstacles to overcome that need to address the usability and computational requirements of these systems  Addressing these challenges requires a combination of new design methodologies to cater to user needs and novel techniques to improve the functionality of these systems  BACKGROUND Technological solutions to aid mental wellbeing are rapidly increasing in popularity   Numerous mental health apps have exceeded 10 million downloads including Calm harm and Headspace demonstrating the popularity of these technological solutions  More recently advancements in the IoT have led to the development of tangible interfaces for mental wellbeing   Tangible interfaces have the potential to have a more significant impact than mobile apps as people are more likely to create stronger emotional attachments with physical devices rather than digital interfaces   Previous mental wellbeing tangible interfaces have focused on promoting the communication and recording of mental wellbeing  EmoEcho  allowed two trusted partners to transmit their  Figure 1  Challenges associated with developing tangible Interfaces for mental wellbeing  emotional wellbeing through haptic feedback in realtime and subtle stone  enabled students to privately transmit their emotions to a teacher through colours  Other tangible interfaces such as Emoball  and mood TUI  aimed to simplify the process of selfreporting emotions  A range of tangible interfaces has previously been developed to sense mental wellbeing including wearables measuring heart rate variability  HRV  and skin conductance   When the physiological sensors were paired with machine learning they could successfully classify stress with an accuracy of 97 4  after 5 minutes demonstrating the capabilities that could be incorporated into mental wellbeing tangible interfaces  It is not only physiological sensors that can be used to sense and promote positive mental wellbeing  Force sensors have been used within a tangible ball that allows for the manipulation of music by sensing varying touch and motion patterns   The research concluded that squeeze music could successfully be used for music therapy with children as it promoted positive emotions through tactile input and music  Further devices have been devised to provide interventions  these devices use a variety of feedback mechanisms with the aim of improving mental wellbeing  Research such as Doppel  and good vibes  show tangible interfaces containing realtime interventional feedback can have positive impacts on mental wellbeing in stressful situations  Tangible interfaces for mental wellbeing have not yet utilised the full potential of recent advancements in IoT  sensors and artificial intelligence  This research aims to explore the common technological and useroriented challenges faced when developing modern tangible and embodied interfaces for mental wellbeing  Figure 1 shows the different types of challenges associated with the design and development of tangible Interfaces for mental wellbeing  TECHNICAL CHALLENGES While advancements in CPUs  microcontrollers and sensors have resulted in smaller  more computationally powerful and accurate devices there are still many challenges to overcome when developing mental wellbeing tangible interfaces  One of the most significant issues currently faced is the physical size of the devices as users prioritise the look and feel of tangible interfaces    Mental wellbeing tangible interfaces must remain small and at the same time embed all of the required sensors  microcontroller and battery and while small powerful processors are available they increase the cost of such devices considerably  Sensor accuracy remains a challenge as to infer mental wellbeing highly accurate sensors are vital  Recent advancements have resulted in off the shelf physiological sensors such as those measuring heart rate variability  HRV  and Electrodermal activity  EDA  to detect stress with similar accuracy  as clinical grade sensors when they are paired with machine learning classifiers   However  the machine learning classifiers must be first be trained with vast amounts of accurate realworld labelled data which can be difficult to obtain  Machine learning provides clear benefits but requires computationally powerful devices to run  Ideally  the classification models would be run ondevice as this would reduce latency and increase privacy as user data would never be transmitted off the device  New devices such as the Raspberry Pi zero are capable of running simple classification models ondevice however their limited ram and larger size still create challenges  Alternatively  small microcontrollers such as the Arduino Nano could be utilised but they only allow for the collection of data  One option to maintain the small footprint of the Arduino Nano but still utilise machine learning is to combine it with Bluetooth Low Energy to transmit the data to a mobile application which can run the classification model  Machine learning could also allow for the provision of personalised mental wellbeing inference  This provides a solution to one of the most challenging aspects when developing a onesizefitsall tangible interface  Each device could be trained on the individual s sensory data resulting in the more accurate inference of mental wellbeing state  However  to achieve personalised inference a large amount of data is required from each individual when experiencing different states of wellbeing  A novel solution to this is the development of tangible interfaces containing the necessary sensors in addition to embedded techniques to selflabel allowing for the collection of large amounts of realworld labelled data that can then be used to accurately train machine learning models  Battery life is an increasing challenge as advancements in the development of more computationally powerful processors and additional sensors have outpaced advancements of batteries resulting in shortened battery life  LiPo batteries are most suitable for mental wellbeing tangible interfaces as they are physically small and rechargeable  unlike 9v alkaline batteries which are commonly used with within the IoT  When developing tangible interfaces using Arduino Nanos and numerous physiological and environmental sensors LiPo batteries between 500mAh and 1200mAh provided an average battery life of between 5 and 10 hours  While this is sufficient for the tangible interfaces if the machine learning classifiers were to run ondevice this would reduce battery life significantly  Many of the above challenges concern the detection of mental wellbeing but if tangible interfaces are to also improve wellbeing there are additional challenges to be overcome  The primary challenge is the use of different feedback mechanisms including auditory  visual and haptic feedback which will need to be examined to confirm their capability to reliably improve mental wellbeing for the general population  USERORIENTATED CHALLENGES In addition to the technical challenges that exist there are also many new useroriented challenges that need to be addressed  many of which are unique to tangible interfaces for wellbeing  Machine learning has been shown to provide many advantages when used to infer mental wellbeing but for it to be accurately trained a large amount of user data is first required making user engagement one of the largest challenges facing the accuracy of tangible interfaces  There are numerous reasons as to why user engagement is often low including digital competence as many users who experience mental health challenges may not possess high digital competence  However  research shows that tangible interfaces do not require high digital competence to be engaging which should result in any individual being able to use such devices   Stigma is another issue which could reduce user engagement as traditionally there is much stigma around mental health and the diagnostic tools used  To combat this stigma the tangible interfaces should be designed to appear inconspicuous  one method to accomplish this is by embedding the sensors into preexisting  familiar devices such as toys for children  By making the devices inconspicuous they are immediately more familiar and approachable for people to use and less stigmatised  Given the stigma associated with mental health  security has to be a top concern for anyone developing or using tangible interfaces for mental wellbeing  Many users consider their mental health data to be highly personal and would not want it shared with any third parties  Because of the sensitive nature of the data ondevice processing would be ideal as the data remains local and secure although this may not always be possible as additional computational power may be required  Legislation could help alleviate concerns as the General Data Protection Regulation  GDPR   in the EU and EEA have attempted to give control to citizens over their personal data by ensuring they can access their data and understand how it is being processed  GDPR may help gain people s trust in mental wellbeing tangible interfaces as it allows people to assess how their personal data is stored and processed  When developing devices to be used by people with mental wellbeing challenges it is essential to involve end users in the development process  Tangible interfaces for mental wellbeing were explored at focus groups at a school for students with severe  profound and complex learning and physical disabilities in Nottingham  UK  these focus groups highlighted additional challenges that must be addressed before mainstream adoption  The cost of the devices was a key concern as they must be affordable for the school or individuals to consider purchasing which can be addressed by using cheap off the shelf sensors and microcontrollers  Durability was another concern raised as children often drop and break technological devices  To address this concern tangible interfaces  specifically designed for children such toys have been developed  these provide additional protection for the electronic components but their durability remains a challenge  Students within the school also face fine and gross motor control issues making many technological solutions such as mobile apps challenging to use but by designing tangible interfaces to be easy to grip and durable it should improve the accessibility of such technology  Codesigning the tangible interfaces is also vital to ensure acceptance and high usability  Designing with people with cognitive impairments is vital because they are often overlooked as  if a mental health problem presents   it is more likely to be attributed to their learning disability  diagnostic overshadowing  or classed as challenging behaviour    Codesigning with people with cognitive impairments does present additional challenges such as legality issues regarding informed consent and the impact of participation as some participants may find it challenging when confronted by their own limitations  However  many of these challenges can be overcome using method stories  which describe how methods work in reality instead of how they ought to work in theory  Many of the useroriented challenges are more difficult to overcome than the technological challenges but user adoption and engagement should be prioritised through codesign workshops to ensure the feasibility and acceptance of mental wellbeing tangible interfaces  CONCLUSION The emergence of mental wellbeing tangible interfaces and advancements in sensors  machine learning and microcontrollers suggest a new era of technological mental wellbeing tools  yet many challenges remain  This paper has pointed to a number of research challenges that warrant further investigation  Many of these challenges are technological including the physical size of many offtheshelf sensors and microcontrollers  the battery life of devices and the processing power required for ondevice machine learning but with current advancements these challenges should become less problematic  There are also many userorientated challenges ranging from difficulties engaging users  codesign challenges and ensuring data privacy  While these challenges remain  it is imperative to involve end users at all stages of the design and development of mental wellbeing tangible interfaces to ensure effective interfaces are developed  Overall mental wellbeing tangible interfaces present a great opportunity for individuals to automatically monitor and improve their wellbeing but many challenges must be overcome by researchers to make this a reality   REFERENCES  Lulwah Albarrak  Eiman Kanjo  and Eman M  G  Younis  2017  NeuroPlace  Categorizing urban places
