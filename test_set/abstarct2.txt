Abstract—Exploiting multi-antenna technologies for robust
beamsteering to overcome the effects of blockage and beam
misalignment is the key to providing seamless multi-Gbps connectivity in 5G-and-beyond mm-wave networks. In this paper, we
present the first large-scale outdoor mm-wave measurement study
using a phased antenna array in a typical European town. We
systematically collect fine-grained 3D angle-of-arrival and angleof-departure data, totaling over 50,000 received signal strength
measurements. We study the impact of phased antenna arrays
in terms of number of link opportunities, achievable data rate
and robustness under small-scale mobility, and compare this
against reference horn antenna measurements. Our results show
a limited number of 2–4 link opportunities per receiver location,
indicating that the mm-wave multipath richness in a European
town is surprisingly similar to that of dense urban metropolises.
The results for the phased antenna array reveal that significant
losses in estimated data rate occur for beam misalignments in the
order of the half-power beamwidth, with significant and irregular
variations for larger misalignments. By contrast, the loss for the
horn antenna is monotonically increasing with the misalignment.
Our results strongly suggest that the effect of non-ideal phased
antenna arrays must be explicitly considered in the design of
agile beamsteering algorithms.
