Multi-antenna technologies are the key enabler for unlocking the potential of millimeter-wave (mm-wave) spectrum
bands in 5G-and-beyond networks [1], [2]. A number of
mm-wave outdoor measurement campaigns, predominantly
using channel sounder setups with horn antennas, e.g. [3]–[9],
have now demonstrated the fundamental feasibility of mmwave links in urban environments and resulted in mm-wave
statistical channel models (see [10] and references therein).
This year has also seen the first test commercial mm-wave
outdoor deployments, albeit with limited capabilities and performance [11]. Directional high-gain antenna beams are used
to overcome the high path loss at mm-wave frequencies, but
the sensitivity to misalignment of antenna beams [6], [12]
and the effect of link blockage due to environmental and
mobile obstacles such as buildings [13] and humans [14],
remain primary challenges for seamless coverage in large-scale
mobile network deployments. The key to making mm-wave

cellular networks a reality is thus exploiting multi-antenna
technology for robust and precise beamsteering to overcome
effects of blockage and beam misalignment caused by large
and small-scale mobility, and provide seamless gigabit-persecond (Gbps) connectivity.
Great advances have been reported in the literature regarding
mm-wave antenna technology [15]–[17], but the evaluation of
these devices has been largely conducted in controlled indoor
environments. The notable exceptions to this are [18]–[21],
which demonstrated outdoor coverage measurements using
mm-wave phased antenna arrays. However, these works lack
fine-grained angle-of-arrival (AoA) and angle-of-departure
(AoD) measurements, which are crucial for understanding
the impact of beam misalignment on mm-wave link and network performance. Other prior outdoor measurement studies,
e.g. [3]–[9], used horn antenna or omni-directional antenna
setups. The existing literature thus offers very limited insight
on the performance of mm-wave antenna arrays in a real
outdoor urban network environment, in particular with respect
to the beamsteering opportunities and beam misalignment
effects, which is an essential input for system-level engineering
design of future mm-wave networks.
In this paper, we present the first large-scale outdoor urban
mm-wave measurement study using a state-of-the-art phased
antenna array, collecting received signal strength (RSS) data
over systematic fine-grained 3D AoA and AoD orientations
in a typical European town. We study the impact of phased
antenna arrays in terms of the number of link opportunities,
achievable data rate and robustness under small-scale mobility,
and directly compare this against reference measurements
using a horn antenna. Our results show a limited number of
2–4 available distinct spatial link opportunities per receiver
location, indicating that the mm-wave multipath richness in a
typical European town center is surprisingly similar to that in
dense urban areas as presented in [3]–[5], [7], [9]. The results
for the phased antenna array reveal that losses in estimated data
rate of up to 70% occur for small beam misalignments in the
order of the half-power beamwidth (HPBW), with significant
and irregular variations in estimated data rate for larger beam
misalignments due to the non-ideal phased antenna array
radiation pattern. By contrast, the loss in estimated data rate
for the horn antenna setup is monotonically increasing with the
orientation error. This shows that earlier measurement studies
[6], [12] or theoretical studies [22], [23] of beam misalignment
effects on mm-wave link and network performance using horn
antennas or idealized directional antenna patterns cannot be

simply generalized. Consequently, we analyze the implications
that our results have on the design for future beamsteering
algorithms in mm-wave outdoor network deployments.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Sec. II gives
the related work overview. Sec. III presents our measurement
setup and methodology. Our measurement results are presented
and analyzed in Sec. IV. In Sec. V we discuss the engineering
implication of our findings for outdoor mm-wave network
deployments. Finally, Sec. VI concludes the paper.
II. RELATED WORK
Recent years have seen great advances in mm-wave phased
antenna arrays and corresponding transceivers for base stations
(BSs) and user equipment (UE). For instance, Samsung [17]
has presented a 28 GHz base station with a 64-element phased
antenna array, IBM and Ericsson [15] have demonstrated a
dual-polarized 28 GHz phased antenna array module with 128
elements, and Sivers IMA has released 16-element mm-wave
phased antenna array [16]. However, these new mm-wave
transceivers and phased antenna array designs have largely
been evaluated in controlled environments [15]–[17], rather
than in real outdoor urban settings. Notable exceptions to
this are the studies in [18]–[21]. In [18], [19], and [20] data
rate measurements with 28 GHz multi antenna arrays were
conducted in outdoor environments, analyzing the possible
coverage in potential mm-wave cells. Yet, these studies did not
include detailed AoA or AoD measurements, which are central
to understanding the impact of non-ideal, mm-wave phased
antenna arrays on the design of beamsteering algorithms for
mm-wave networks. In [21] the RSS over AoD was measured
at several receiver positions in a car park using an omnidirectional antenna at the receiver and a 60 GHz phased
antenna array at the transmitter side, finding strong reflected
paths for many receiver positions. However, [21] did not
investigate beamsteering opportunities and limitations caused
by beam misalignment, due to the lack of AoA data. By
contrast, in this work we present the results of the first
comprehensive large-scale urban measurement campaign with
mm-wave phased antenna arrays systematically collecting RSS
over fine-grained AoA and AoD antenna orientations.
Independently from the advances in mm-wave multi-antenna
technology, a number of mm-wave measurement campaigns
have been conducted in outdoor environments with the aim
of establishing statistical mm-wave channel models (see [2]
and references therein). Rappaport et al. [3] conducted seminal measurements at 28, 38, 60 and 70 GHz in Austin,
Texas, and New York City using a sliding correlator channel
sounder with mechanically steerable horn antennas to record
the power delay profile for a limited selected range of AoA and
AoD combinations at each TX/RX pair. Similar measurement
methodologies have been employed in other measurement
campaigns, e.g. [4], [5], [7]–[9], and measurement-based statistical channel models such as the NYU model [25] have
consequently been proposed (see [10] and references therein).
Overall, analyzing the number of potential link opportunities,
the studies in [3]–[5], [7], [9] reported a limited number of
2–5 mm-wave multipath clusters per TX/RX pair for urban
areas in different metropolises. However, as these measurements campaigns were conducted with horn or omnidirectional
antenna setups, they do not allow us to study the impact of
phased antenna arrays on potential link opportunities and beam
misalignment in mm-wave networks. By contrast, in this work
we collected RSS data with mm-wave phased antenna arrays
over fine-grained AoA and AoD sample points to study these
open questions. Additionally, we conducted measurements in a
typical European town rather than a big city like prior studies
in the literature.
Lee et al. [12] studied the effect of beam misalignment
based on measurements taken with a channel sounder and horn
antennas. To that end, power measurements were systematically collected across azimuth angles at 28 and 38 GHz in both
free-space and urban environments. The general conclusion
based on these horn antenna measurements was that for a fixed
beamwidth, the power loss increases linearly with increasing
beam misalignment until saturation is reached. This confirms
the results of Simic´ et al. in [6], where the RSS over AoA
and AoD was systematically measured with a horn antenna
setup in an urban environment in the 60 GHz band. The
results in [6], [12] stand in stark contrast to the results of our
phased antenna array measurements in this paper, which show
a non-linear relationship between misalignment and power
loss. To demonstrate that this is caused by the non-ideal,
phased antenna array pattern, we also explicitly compare our
measurements against those with a horn antenna in the same
outdoor scenarios. Our comparison underlines the paradigm
shift that occurs in terms of beam misalignment effects when
moving from horn antennas to real phased antenna arrays.
In addition to empirical research, the effect of beam misalignment on mm-wave network performance has also been
addressed from a theoretical perspective, e.g. in [22], [23].
These approaches typically make use of simple and idealized
antenna radiation pattern models to investigate the effect of
fundamental antenna parameters such as beamwidth on various
metrics of system performance. Moreover, analyses regarding
beam misalignments have mainly focused on misalignments
smaller than the main lobe beamwidth [22]. Wildman et al.
[23] do consider larger beam misalignments from a theoretical
perspective and show that in theory sidelobes can be beneficial
to the success probability of a transmission in low density networks and that the spatial throughput and transmission capacity maximizing beamwidth has a nearly linear relationship with
the mean orientation error for Gaussian and sectored antenna
radiation pattern models. As such idealized radiation pattern
models are much more similar to a horn antenna radiation
pattern than that of a real mm-wave phased antenna array,
our results strongly suggest that such a linear relationship will
not hold in real mm-wave deployments and that the severe
consequences of this idealization on the requirements and
opportunities of beamsteering algorithms and network system
design have been underestimated. Therefore, our work forms
a basis for realistic models of beam misalignment effects in
urban 5G-and-beyond mm-wave networks.

III. MEASUREMENT SETUP & METHODOLOGY
Our outdoor measurement campaign was conducted in the
German town of Langenfeld. The measurement area constitutes the central pedestrian zone with mainly shops in the
surroundings and only delivery trucks being allowed to enter.
The buildings typically have 2-5 floors and are constructed
of concrete with large windows and some metal parts on the
facades. The measurements were conducted over the course
of 12 days during the summer of 2018, with dry weather and
temperatures of around 25◦ C.
The transmitter (TX) was located at different positions on
the rooftop of a multi-floor car park at a height of 9.7 m. The
receiver (RX) positions A–D were located in the pedestrian
zone, i.e. on ground level, with the mounted antenna at a height
of 1.7 m. Fig. 1 shows an aerial image of the area where
the TX positions (1, 2) and RX positions (A, B, C, D) are
marked. Fig. 2 shows the different TX and RX positions during
the measurements. The RX is circled in green and the TX in
orange. In case the LOS is blocked, a green square indicates
the geometric LOS direction. The positions were chosen based
on representative scenarios as follows:
• TX1-RXA: Typical scenario for small cell, with clear LOS
and TX-RX distance of 25 m (Figs. 2a-2b).
• TX1-RXB and TX2-RXB: RX-B was chosen to investigate
the effects of an obstructed LOS and evaluate the coverage from different TX positions for the same RX position.
In scenario TX1-RXB the LOS is partially blocked by
a building corner, while in scenario TX2-RXB the LOS
is partially blocked by a lamp-post with a flower box
mounted on it (Figs. 2c-2f).
• TX1-RXC: Represents a typical street canyon with 18 m
width and buildings to the left and to the right. The
large TX-RX distance of 65 m makes this representative
of cell-edge distances in a mm-wave small cell. The
LOS path was predominantly clear despite tree foliage
(Figs. 2g-2h).
• TX2-RXD: Scenario chosen to investigate the effect of tree
foliage on mm-wave coverage, with a TX-RX distance
of 28 m and clearly visible trees obstructing the LOS
(Figs. 2i - 2j).
For our measurement campaign we used two different
60 GHz transceiver setups, one utilizing a phased antenna
array and the other utilizing a standard horn antenna for
comparison. A relatively narrowband signal transmission was
chosen (1 MHz) to obtain fine-grained RSS and angle orientation data, allowing us to have a robust setup that does
not require strict calibration as the gain over the frequency
band is flat and the time-component of the channel is not
recorded. Importantly, since we are not interested in a timecharacterization of the channel, the narrowband power measurements are sufficient for our objective of characterizing
mm-wave link opportunities in a typical outdoor environment
and beamsteering requirements for maintaining a reliable link
connectivity under small-scale mobility. Both setups utilize
software-defined radios (SDRs), facilitating transport and use
in different locations. We note that the frequency bands in
the range of 24–86 GHz are under consideration for 5G-andbeyond mm-wave cellular networks [27]. In this paper, we
report measurements in the 60 GHz band without the loss of
generality, due to equipment availability and for comparability
with prior mm-wave outdoor urban measurement studies,
e.g. [3], [6], [18], [21].
A. Phased Antenna Array Setup
We used the SiversIMA 60 GHz phased antenna array radio
frequency integrated circuit (RFIC) TRX BF/01 [24] with the
corresponding evaluation kit EVK06002 [28]. The setup is
capable of operating in the frequency range from 57 GHz–
71 GHz. The included RF module uses direct conversion in
both TX and RX mode. It includes a 16+16 (TX/RX) patch
antenna module, with each antenna array consisting of 16×2
microstrip patch antenna elements directly connected to the
RFIC [16]. Fig. 3a shows a schematic drawing of the phased
antenna array board and the RFIC. The phase weights and
amplitudes are applied to the signal in the analog RF domain
using 16 independent RF paths. Thus, only azimuth plane
beamsteering is allowed in the range [+45◦
, −45◦
], based on a
codebook with up to 64 different antenna pattern entries. The
phased array transceiver was controlled via a USB interface.
Figs. 3c-3d compare the measured phased antenna array radiation pattern with the simulated one obtained using
MATLAB’s phased antenna array toolbox based on generic
patch antenna elements. We note the considerable differences
between the ideal simulated radiation pattern and the real, nonideal measured radiation pattern.

is shown in Fig. 4. The left part of the figure shows the
TX including host PC 1, USRP X310 SDR with LFTX
daughterboards, and the phased antenna array transceiver.
The right part of the figure shows the RX consisting of an
equivalent setup. The host PC 1 generates a complex sinusoidal
signal at the frequency fsin = 250 kHz and streams it to the
USRP. The USRP generates a baseband signal with a sampling
rate fs = 1 MHz which is fed to the phased antenna array
transceiver. The phased antenna array transceiver upconverts
the signal to a frequency fc = 58.32 GHz, and transmits the
signal over the air. The RX phased antenna array downconverts
the received signal and feeds it to the USRP, which samples the
signal with a sampling rate fs = 1 MHz. The complex samples
are streamed to the host PC 2, where the power spectrum of the
received signal is computed using a flattop window. Finally,
the signal strength RSSA,meas of the received sinusoidal signal
is extracted from the power spectrum, which was calibrated
against an Agilent E4440A spectrum analyzer.
B. Horn Antenna Setup
For comparison, our second setup used the FC1005V/00
V-band converter by SiversIMA [29] and a standard 15 dBi
gain horn antenna by Flann Microwave [30]. The FC1005V/00
is capable of up- and downconverting to and from 57-66 GHz
using an intermediate frequency (IF) bandwidth of 1-5 GHz.
Fig. 3b shows the simulated radiation pattern of the standard
gain horn antenna.
The schematic of the horn antenna setup is shown in Fig. 5.
The left part of the figure shows the TX including the host
PC 1, USRP N210 with WBX daughterboard, Sivers IMA
FC1005V/00 upconverter and the horn antenna. The right part
of the figure shows the RX consisting of a similar setup
as the TX. The transmission and reception signal chain of
the horn antenna setup is equivalent to the phased antenna
array setup (cf. Sec. III-A), except that the signal between the
USRP and up-/downconverter is at the intermediate frequeny
fIF = 1.32 GHz and not at baseband. The RSS at the horn
antenna setup RSSH,meas was obtained by the same calibrated
procedure as described in Sec. III-A.

C. Measurement Procedure
To identify potential link opportunities and their respective
antenna orientations (AoD, AoA), we systematically swept the
angular space by changing the beam orientations at the TX and
RX. Each beam orientation can be characterized by a pair of
azimuth and elevation angles (φ, θ). As the phased antenna
array transceiver only allows beamsteering in a 90◦
azimuth
range and the horn antenna setup cannot electronically steer
its beam, we have used a custom made 3D turntable to help
cover the complete angular space with additional mechanical
movements when the range of electronic beamsteering was
exceeded. The turntable uses two stepper motors for azimuth
and elevation movement. The automated 3D turntable with the
mounted phased antenna array transceiver is shown in Fig. 6a.
1) Phased Antenna Array Transceiver: For the measurements, we covered all orientations within azimuth
φRX ∈ [−180◦
, 180◦
) and elevation θRX ∈ [−30◦
, 60◦
] at
each RX position. The range of elevation angles was chosen
based on observation of potential link opportunities, taking
into account the positioning of the TX and RX. The elevation
resolution of ∆θRX = 30◦ was chosen based on the E-plane
HPBW of 36◦
found in the phased antenna array radiation
pattern measurements (cf. Fig. 3d). The azimuth resolution
was chosen to be ∆φ = 6
◦
corresponding to the HPBW of the
azimuth-plane radiation pattern (cf. Fig. 3c). To change the
azimuth angle orientation at the RX, we used a combination of
mechanical movement by the 3D turntable and the electronic
beamsteering, φRX = φtt + φbeam, as shown in Fig. 6b.
The measurement time per RX orientation (φRX, θRX) was
1 second. A complete sweep over all RX orientations for a
single fixed TX orientation took 500 s.
Once such an RX sweep was finished, the TX changed
its azimuth orientation and another RX measurement run
was started. Analogously to the RX, the transmitting phased
antenna array transceiver was mounted on a 3D turntable, with
the elevation angle fixed to θT X = −15◦ based on the large
E-Plane HPBW and the higher positioning on the rooftop
of a parking lot. The azimuth angle of the TX orientation
was changed in ∆φT X = 6
◦
steps by a combination of
mechanical turntable movement and electronic beamsteering,
as described previously. The range of azimuth angles to be
covered was chosen to be φT X ∈ [−90◦
, 84◦
] w.r.t. the initial
TX antenna orientation. Hence, the total measurement time for
all TX/RX combinations with the phased antenna array setup
was 30×500 s, or 4 hours and 10 minutes. The overall angular
coverage per position is presented in Table I.
2) Horn Antenna Array Transceiver: To mechanically steer
the transceiver in various orientations, the horn antenna RX
setup was mounted on a 3D turntable, similar to that shown
in Fig. 6a for the phased antenna array. For the measurements,
we chose to cover all RX azimuth angles φRX ∈ [−180◦
, 180◦
)
with a resolution ∆φRX = 6
◦
, identical to the phased antenna
array setup, so that the obtained results can be readily compared. Furthermore, we chose to cover the range of elevation
angles θRX ∈ [−30◦
, 60◦
] with a higher resolution than for the
phased antenna array setup, i.e. ∆θRX = 10◦
, to allow a finergrained identification of AoA and identify potential scattering
or reflecting objects. On the transmitter side, the horn antenna
setup was also mounted on a 3D turntable and the elevation
angle was fixed to θT X = −15◦
, as used for the phased antenna
array and in accordance with the broad E-Plane HPBW of 34◦
(cf. Fig. 3b).
A measurement run for a fixed transmitter orientation took
considerably longer using the horn antenna setup than using
the phased antenna array setup, due to the fact that all movements in elevation or azimuth were achieved by mechanical
movement of the 3D turntable. To strike a balance between the
time spent for measurements with each setup, we limited the
range of horn antenna TX azimuth angles per measurement
position, ensuring that a minimum range of 54◦
centered

D. Post-Processing of Measurement Data
In our analysis in Sec. IV, we take two different perspectives
on our measurement results. First, we study the link opportunities in a typical European town in Sec. IV-A, i.e. we are
essentially interested in the path loss that a signal experiences
between TX and RX for different antenna orientations. Therefore, we present the RSS of both measurement setups for
a normalized nominal link budget so as to eliminate effects
that may occur due to different antenna gains or different
equivalent isotropically radiated powers (EIRPs) between the
measurement setups. Second, we estimate the achievable data
rate in mm-wave cells to analyze the effect of beam misalignment on the link performance, presented in Sec. IV-B. To this
end, we assume the TX to be a BS operating at a fixed EIRP,
and estimate the achievable data rates at the receiving UE
based on our measurements. In the following, we detail the
post-processing steps taken to obtain the data presented in
Sec. IV-A and Sec. IV-B from our RSS measurements.
RSS with Normalized Nominal Link Budget: We obtain the
normalized RSS for the phased antenna array setup RSSA
and the horn antenna setup RSSH from the measured RSS
RSSA,meas and RSSH,meas, respectively, by making equal the
nominal link budget for both measurement setups, i.e.
RSSA = RSSA,meas + Cc, (1)
RSSH = RSSH,meas . (2)
The constant Cc is the difference between the actual link
budgets of the measurement setups, i.e.
Cc = E IRPH + GH − (E IRPA + GA), (3)
where E IRPH and E IRPA are the EIRPs of the horn antenna
setup and the phased antenna array setup during the measurements, respectively, and GH and GA are the estimated main
lobe antenna gains of the horn antenna and the phased antenna
array, respectively. The values of these parameters are given
in Table II. We note that the validity of our results is not
compromised by this operation as the sensitivity of the phased
antenna array setup SA,meas was considerably lower than the
sensitivity of the horn antenna setup SH,meas. The sensitivity
of our overall measurement system after the normalization is
still limited by the horn antenna measurement setup, i.e.
S = max{SH,meas, SA,meas + Cc } = −91 dBm. (4)
The normalized received signal strengths RSSA and RSSH
obtained after this post-processing operation are presented in
Sec. IV-A .
Estimating Achievable Data Rate: To analyze the effect
of beam misalignment on the link performance in mmwave cells, we mapped RSSA,meas and RSSH,meas to the
estimated achievable data rate T, assuming a fixed BS EIRP
of E IRPBS = 25 dBm, in line with existing regulations for
wideband transmissions at 60 GHz [31]. First, the measured
received signal strengths RSSA,meas and RSSH,meas were
scaled according to the additional power that receivers would
receive for a BS transmitting with E IRPBS, i.e.
RSS0
A = RSSA,meas + (E IRPBS − E IRPA), (5)
RSS0
H = RSSH,meas + (E IRPBS − E IRPH ). (6)
The overall sensitivity S
0 of our overall measurement system
is then given by
S
0 = max{SH,meas + (E IRPBS − E IRPH ),
SA,meas + (E IRPBS − E IRPA)} (7)
= −75.61 dBm. (8)
To then map RSS0
A
and RSS0

IV. MEASUREMENT RESULTS & ANALYSIS
In this section, we present the results of the measurement
campaign outlined in Sec. III. In Sec. IV-A, we analyze
available link opportunities in terms of the observed multipath
clusters based on measured RSS, and we trace the corresponding independent physical propagation paths between TX and
RX. In Sec. IV-B, we analyze the effects of beam misalignment
on the estimated achievable mm-wave data rate.
A. Link Opportunities & AoA Analysis
In the following, we study significant link opportunities
that were found during our measurement campaign, trace the
corresponding physical propagation paths on an environment
map and analyze the observed differences between the phased
antenna array and horn antenna measurement data. To that
end, we present our results as follows. Figs. 7-8 present
the RSS versus RX orientations in a heatmap which allows
us to investigate the structure of received multipath clusters.
Here we assume for each RX orientation (φRX, θRX) the best
corresponding transmitter orientation φT X found during the
measurements, in order to show the full set of multipath
clusters available at each receiver location. Fig. 9 illustrates
the same underlying data as in Figs. 7-8 in terms of the AoA

and how it is related to the environment, showing polar plots
of the RSS in a schematic environment map of the study area.
Finally, we present Fig. 10 where we trace the corresponding
independent physical propagation paths between TX and RX
based on the AoA, AoD, and potential reflectors in the study
area. In the following, our results are presented based on
Figs. 7-10 location-by-location.
We start our analysis with a typical scenario for a mm-wave
small cell with a clear LOS, i.e. at RX location A. As expected,
a strong LOS cluster is observed for both the horn antenna and
the phased antenna array measurement setup in the heatmaps
in Fig. 7a and Fig. 8a, respectively. Nonetheless, we observe
the distinct effect of the different antenna patterns on the RSS
measured with respect to the RX steering angle. While the
horn antenna measurement in Fig. 7a exhibits a smooth cluster,
the same cluster appears irregular for the phased antenna array
measurement shown in Fig. 8a2
. Similarly, the AoA polar plot
for scenario 1A in Fig. 9a allows us to clearly recognize the
impact of the horn antenna and phased antenna array radiation
patterns (cf. Fig. 3b– 3c). The consequence of this is that
the non-ideal, phased antenna array radiation pattern makes it
much more difficult to identify true independent propagation
paths. For instance, let us consider in Fig. 9a the AoA polar
plot, which exhibits several peaks for the phased antenna array
RSS. The first peak around φRX = 0
◦ points in the LOS
direction. Additionally, we observe peaks around φRX = −30◦
,

In Fig. 8, we note that the measurement points are not spaced equidistantly
over azimuth angles φRX . This is due to the imperfect beam steering with
the manufacturer-supplied beambook, i.e. we observed an offset between the
beam steering angle that we set and the actual angle of the main lobe seen at
the over-the-air interface. We measured the offset for all beamsteering angles
and correct for these offsets during the post-processing of the results.

φRX = 30◦
, φRX = −84◦
, and φRX = 127◦
. Taking into
account AoD information (not shown for brevity), we can
identify that the high RSSs at φRX = −84◦
and φRX = 127◦
correspond to independent secondary NLOS paths, which are
shown in the environment map in Fig. 10a. By contrast, the
high RSSs around φRX = −30◦
and φRX = 30◦
are due to
sidelobes that point into the LOS direction, thereby falsely
indicating independent propagation paths. This is clear when
looking at the map in Fig. 9a, as there are no reflectors at
φRX = −30◦
and φRX = 30◦
from the RX. However, this
may cause problems to beamsteering algorithms that do not
have information about the environment and the AoD. For
instance, an algorithm may generate a list of orientations
supposedly corresponding to viable independent propagation
paths during initial beam training. Then in the case of detected
blockage on the primary path, it may switch to a falsely
indicated propagation path, i.e. it switches to a sidelobe over
the same path. Consequently, it would fail to overcome the
link blockage.
We next consider RX location B. Again we start our analysis
by comparing the heatmap of the horn antenna measurement
in Fig. 7b with the heatmap of the phased antenna array
measurement in Fig. 8b. In line with the observations for
RX location A, we note the significant differences between
the cluster appearance for horn antenna and phased antenna
array measurements. However, in contrast to the results at RX
location A, two almost equally strong multipath clusters are
observed for RX location B. Fig. 9b shows the AoA polar plot
for the measurement scenario 1B. Combining knowledge of the
AoA, the environment, and the steered phased antenna array
radiation pattern, we can trace the two physical propagation
paths as shown in Fig. 10a, where the NLOS path likely
included the reflection from a shop window. Nonetheless, we
observe again that tracing the physical propagation paths is
difficult purely based on AoA information (cf. Fig. 9b), as
previously described for receiver location A. In contrast to
the measurement 1Aa, we point out that AoD information
is not helpful in measurement scenario 1Ba to distinguish
between a true independent propagation path and a sidelobeinduced high RSS. The reason is that the AoD is the same
for both the LOS and NLOS path (cf. Fig. 10a) with our
AoD measurement resolution of around 6
◦
. Overall, we can
draw two conclusions based on these observations. On the one
hand, the observation of having multiple link opportunities is
promising for mm-wave system designers as it suggests that
mm-wave coverage can also be provided for urban scenarios
with a partly blocked LOS. On the other hand, our results
suggest that even knowing both AoA and AoD may not be
sufficient to reliably identify true independent propagation
paths. Instead, we used both a priori environment information
and knowledge of the real steered phased antenna array radiation pattern to identify such independent propagation paths. In
practice, future commmercial mobile mm-wave systems will
not have such perfect, a priori information. Consequently,
other strategies will be needed to identify true independent
propagation paths. For instance, in scenarios with high link
budget, using a nearly omni-directional radiation pattern at the
receiver to record the power delay profile may allow extracting
the number of independent propagation paths based on time
of arrival [7]. Alternatively, environment-awareness will be
essential for robust mm-wave beamsteering.
Let us now consider RX location C to investigate a LOS
scenario that is similar to that of RX location A. The
differences are an increased TX–RX distance and the fact
that RX C is positioned in an 18 m wide street canyon
with buildings to either side. Nonetheless, the heatmap of
the horn antenna measurement in Fig. 7c and the phased
antenna array measurement in Fig. 8c strongly resemble the
heatmaps obtained for RX location A (cf. Fig. 7a and Fig. 8a,
respectively). We combine the knowledge of the AoA shown in
Fig. 9c, AoD (not shown here for brevity) and the knowledge
of the environment to trace the independent NLOS paths for
RX location C. These are shown in the environment map in
Fig. 10a. However, we emphasize that these are difficult to
trace solely based on the AoA polar plot in Fig. 9c due to the

irregular, phased antenna array radiation pattern. For instance,
the AoA at RX location C (cf. Fig. 9c) looks similar to the
AoA at RX location A (cf. Fig. 9a). Yet, at RX location A
the high RSS at angle φRX = 30◦
is caused by a sidelobe
whereas it corresponds to a true independent propagation path
at RX location C. This underlines the difficulty of identifying
viable independent physical propagation paths by one-sided
RSS measurements.
Let us now investigate measurements that were conducted
with the TX at location TX 2, i.e. at the corner of the car
park. First, we consider the RX location B for which we
already discussed the measurement results from a transmitter
at location TX 1. Again the LOS is obstructed, this time by
a lamppost with a flower box mounted on it. The distance
between TX 2 and RX B was 63 m. Fig. 8d shows the
heatmap for the TX 2 - RX B pair, where we note several
multipath clusters, the strongest received around φRX = −71◦
.
Fig. 9d shows the corresponding AoA polar plot, where
we can see the peaks around φRX = −71◦
, φRX = 115◦
,
and φRX = 0
◦
. All three orientations correspond to true
independent signal propagation paths as shown in the environment map in Fig. 10b. The signal was likely reflected
at several shop windows. The independent propagation paths
were traced and distinguished from sidelobe-induced high RSS
using information about the environment and the steered RX
phased antenna array radiation pattern (not shown here for
brevity). The latter does not have sidelobes that could have
caused a high RSS at these RX orientations. We emphasize that
AoD information cannot help to distinguish true independent
propagation paths from sidelobes, as previously described for
measurement 1Ba. Overall, these results support the previous
observations that multiple mm-wave link opportunities can
be found even in distant and NLOS scenarios in the given
urban environment, but identifying independent propagation
paths requires combined knowledge from different sources, i.e.
environmental awareness, beyond pure RSS measurements.
Finally, we evaluate the measurement results from RX
location D where the LOS path from the transmitter in location
TX 2 was obstructed by the foliage of a tree. Nevertheless, the
heatmap in Fig. 8e shows higher RSS values at φRX = 0
◦
, i.e.
in the direction of the transmitter, than for other orientations.
The path loss for the LOS path is 8 dB higher than free
space path loss, likely due to the foliage. In addition to the
LOS path, we can identify NLOS paths based on the AoA
polar plot in Fig. 9e, AoD (not shown here for brevity), and
knowledge of the environment. Metal columns in front of a
building and a lamppost likely reflected the signals as shown
in the environment map in Fig. 10b.
Overall, our measurements show 2–4 multipath clusters per
receiver position. Reflections were mainly caused by metal or

glass on facades and, somewhat surprisingly, by lampposts,
enabling potential NLOS links in multiple scenarios. We
observed significant differences between the measurements
with the phased antenna arrays as compared to measurements
with the horn antenna. In particular, we noted that determining independent propagation paths purely based on onesided phased antenna array RSS measurements was not a
reliable approach. Instead, knowledge of both AoA and AoD,
and of the actual environment, was needed to identify such
independent propagation paths. Additionally, due to smallscale movements of a user or non-ideal beam training, the
transmitter and the receiver may not be perfectly aligned. In
Sec. IV-B we therefore present an analysis of the effects of
beam misalignment at transmitter and receiver on achievable
data rates of the mm-wave link opportunities revealed by our
measurements.
B. Analysis of Beam Misalignment Effects
In this section we study the effect of beam misalignment
on the link performance in outdoor mm-wave networks, using

the estimated achievable data rate as calculated from (9) as
the performance metric. We emphasize that considering the
achievable data rate rather than solely RSS measurements
(as in Sec. IV-A) allows us to better understand and assess
the networking consequences of misaligned beams, especially
with regard to higher system layers that need to cope with
the resulting changes in the achievable PHY data rate. To
illustrate this, in Fig. 11 we show the heatmap of estimated
data rate versus RX orientation for RX location A (cf. Fig. 7a
and Fig. 8a for the corresponding RSS versus RX orientation
heatmaps). From the heatmap in Fig. 11b, it is evident that a
phased antenna array beam misalignment of a few degrees in
the azimuth can result in a dramatic loss in data rate.
In real mm-wave outdoor deployments such beam misalignments can occur for several reasons. Fig. 12 illustrates several
typical scenarios, where we consider the BS to be the transmitter and the UE to be the receiver, i.e. the downlink. After
successful initial beam training, the BS and UE are ideally
perfectly aligned. However, imperfect beam training due to
e.g. stale beam training data or ambiguous information about
independent propagation paths (as described in Sec. IV-A)
may result in beam misalignments. Such beam misalignments
can occur at the BS and at the UE as shown in Fig. 12a.
Additionally, a UE beam misalignment may be caused by a
rotation of the device, as illustrated in Fig. 12b. Fig. 12c shows
how a small-scale lateral movement of the UE out of the BS’s
beam causes a beam misalignment at both BS and UE. The UE
may then readjust its beam orientation to try and mitigate the
effects of the BS beam misalignment, as illustrated in Fig. 12d.
In the following, we analyze how these beam misalignment
scenarios affect the estimated achievable data rate based on
our measured RSS data. We note that even though we focus
our analysis on the downlink scenario, the general causes for
beam misalignment as shown in Fig. 12 are the same for the
uplink case.
1) BS Beam Misalignment Analysis: After initial beam
training, mobile users in a mm-wave network can cause a BS
beam misalignment for example by physically moving out of
the BS’s beam (cf. Fig. 12c). Similarly, imperfect beam train-

ing may result in a BS beam misalignment (cf. Fig. 12a). In
this section, we study the residual loss in estimated achievable
data rate for such BS beam misalignments, assuming that the
UE locally adjusts its orientation dynamically to mitigate the
BS beam misalignment effects (cf. Figs. 12a and 12d). Namely,
we consider
T(∆T X) = max
φRX,θRX
T(∆T X, φRX, θRX), (12)
where ∆T X is the beam misalignment with respect to the best
possible BS orientation φT X,best, i.e.
∆T X = φT X − φT X,best, (13)
φT X,best = arg max T(φT X, φRX, θRX). (14)
We neglect the elevation misalignment based on the assumption that all UEs are in the same plane, such that the BS’s
elevation beam misalignment is negligible as compared to the
BS’s elevation HPBW of 36◦
. We note that the best possible
BS orientation corresponds to LOS links for the scenarios 1A,
1C, and 2D, and to NLOS links for the scenarios 1B and 2B.
In Fig. 13 we show the estimated achievable data rate T
of a link over the BS (TX) beam misalignment ∆T X with
respect to the best possible BS orientation φT X,best. Based
on Figs. 13a–13b we make three observations about beam
misalignment for our phased antenna array setup. First, we
observe that the maximum data rate is only achieved without
beam misalignment, i.e. there is only one maximum peak.
Second, small beam misalignments in the order of the HPBW
cause significant losses in data rate of up to 70%. For instance,
a beam misalignment of −7
◦
in scenario 1A produces a drop
from 4 Gbps to 1.4 Gbps and from 2.6 Gbps to 0.8 Gbps
in scenario 2D. Third, the loss in data rate is not increasing
monotonically with increasing beam misalignment. Overall,

the results in Figs. 13a–13b demonstrate that a UE locally
adjusting its orientation is not sufficient to fully mitigate the
effects of BS beam misalignment. Consequently, strategies for
tracking UE movement at the BS are required to maintain
high data rates. Moreover, given the observed non-monotonic
relationship between beam misalignment and loss in data rate,
we expect that some types of beam tracking algorithms will not
work reliably. For instance, let us consider an RSS-gradientfollowing beam tracking approach, i.e. an algorithm that tries
to find the ideal beam orientation by adapting the beam
orientation of its phased antenna array beam to a neighboring
orientation that achieves a higher RSS. Due to the observed
irregular variation of the achievable data rate over increasing
beam misalignment, it would not be able to find the global
optimal orientation.
In Fig. 13c, we present the estimated maximum data rate
over the horn antenna BS beam misalignment for comparison
with the phased antenna array results. We observe that the data
rates decrease monotonically with increasing misalignment
which is in contrast to the observations made in Figs. 13a–13b
for the phased antenna array. We emphasize that this stark
dissimilarity between the results for the antenna types indicates

that we cannot simply infer the impact of beam misalignments
on mm-wave links based on measurements taken with horn
antennas as in e.g. [6], [12] or calculations based on simplistic
directional antenna radiation pattern models as in e.g. [23].
Instead, realistic phased antenna array radiation patterns have
to be explicitly taken into account in the design of beam
training and tracking algorithms.
2) UE Beam Misalignment Analysis: In Figs. 12b–12c we
illustrated how a rotation or small-scale movement of the UE
may result in a UE beam misalignment. Similarly, imperfect
beam training as shown in Fig. 12a may lead to a UE beam
misalignment. In this section, we study the effects of such UE
beam misalignments, assuming that the BS locally adjusts its
orientation dynamically to mitigate the UE beam misalignment
effects. We thus apply the same principle of considering onesided misalignment only, as in the previous analysis of the BS

In Fig. 14 we present the loss in estimated data rate T for
a UE (RX) antenna beam misalignment ∆RX with respect to
the best possible UE orientation. Figs. 14a–14c show results
for both measurement setups, where we again observe that
a misalignment causes a gradual loss in data rate for the
horn antenna results, whereas the phased antenna array results
vary rather irregularly. This confirms that we cannot simply
infer the impact of beam misalignments on mm-wave links
based on measurements taken with horn antennas. Moreover,
in Figs. 14a–14e we find that a small misalignment of the UE
phased antenna array beam of up to 8◦
results in losses of
data rate between 6–60%. This demonstrates that even with
perfect UE tracking, agile beamsteering at the UE is needed
to compensate residual losses in data rate due to misalignment.
One key to enabling mm-wave networks is to successfully
integrate UE phased antenna arrays that can reliably maintain a
connection over all 3D orientations. As described in Sec. III-A,
the phased antenna array used in our measurements only
allows azimuth beamsteering while having a wide elevation
HPBW of 36◦
. To investigate if this is a suitable configuration
for a mm-wave UE, we isolate the effect of the UE elevation
angle on estimated data rates. We expect that the best data rate
would be achieved for the measured elevation angles θRX that
are closest to the ideal elevation orientation towards the BS,
which can be computed from the distances between BS and UE
(cf. Table I). Namely, we expect the scenarios 1A and 2D to
achieve approximately equal maximum estimated achievable
data rate for θRX = 0
◦
and θRX = 30◦
, as the distances
between BS and UE was the shortest in these cases, implying
a greater elevation angle. For larger distances between BS and
UE, the ideal elevation angle is smaller and we expect to see
the maximum estimated achievable data rate for the scenarios
1B, 1C, and 2B at θRX = 0
◦
.
13
Fig. 15 shows boxplots of the estimated data rate T over all
azimuth angles φRX ∈ [−180◦
, 180◦
] for UE elevation angle
θRX, i.e. we consider
T(θRX) = max
φT X
T(φT X, φRX, θRX). (18)
We observe a drop in maximum estimated data rate for all
results except 1A when the elevation angle is not equal to 0◦
.
This is expected, except for the result 2D which shows an
outlier achieving around 2.6 Gbps for θRX = 0
◦
. This may be
due to the tree foliage that blocked the LOS between TX and
RX (cf. Fig. 2i). Overall, despite the large HPBW of the phased
antenna array pattern in the elevation plane of 36◦
, the loss in
the maximum achievable estimated data rate ranges between
26% and 70% for a change in elevation angle θRX from 0◦
to 60◦ over all results presented in Fig. 15. Therefore, we
conclude that 2D beamsteering will not be sufficient to fully
exploit available UE link opportunities in a 3D environment.
3) Two-sided Beam Misalignment Analysis: In the previous
sections, we treated the effects of BS and UE beam misalignment separately. However, in real outdoor mm-wave network
deployments, a misalignment at both BS and UE is likely to
occur simultaneously (cf. Fig. 12). We now study this case
for the phased antenna array results, i.e. the beamsteering
opportunities at the UE for a given BS beam misalignment.
To this end, in Figs. 16-17 we show the estimated data rate T
over UE (RX) azimuth angles φRX for selected measurement
scenarios and for selected representative BS (TX) orientations
φT X. In Figs. 16-17 we only consider the UE elevation angle
θRX = 0
◦
, which was observed to achieve the highest data
rates over all elevation angles (cf. Fig. 15).
In Fig. 16 the BS orientations φT X were selected to study the
effects of small-scale misalignment in the order of the HPBW
of around 6
◦
. From Fig. 16 it is evident that the UE achieves
the highest estimated data rate and has the maximum number
of viable orientations when the transmitter is well aligned, i.e.
φT X = 0
◦ or φT X = ±3
◦
. A small-scale misalignment of the
transmitter of ±7
◦
to ±10◦ produces a significant decrease
in the maximum estimated data rate of up to 54%. For a
misalignment in the order of ±7
◦
at both BS and UE, the
loss in estimated data rate is 38%–100% with a median of
70% across all our results. Overall, we conclude that the
joint effect of small-scale beam misalignment at BS and UE
results in severe losses in data rate, placing the burden on agile
beamtracking algorithms to update BS and UE orientation at
a sufficient rate to ensure robustness of high data rate links
for mobile users.
In Fig. 17 the BS orientations φT X were selected to study
link opportunities that occur due to sidelobes or independent
secondary propagation paths, i.e. at orientations that deviate
at large-scale from the best orientation. In Fig. 17a, for
φT X = 30◦
the overall estimated data rates are below those
for φT X = 0
◦
, but the shape of the curve is similar. This
suggests that the transmitter has a sidelobe towards the receiver
when oriented at φT X = 30◦
, using the same propagation path
as for φT X = 0
◦
. By contrast, we observe an independent
secondary (NLOS) propagation path for φRX = −84◦
and
φT X = 41◦ which was also traced on the environment map

of the study area (cf. Fig. 10a). Fig. 17b reveals the same
trend. The φRX-dependent link opportunities for φT X = −37◦
are similar to those for φT X = 3
◦
, suggesting that they
resulted from a sidelobe of the transmitter. For φT X = −29◦
,
a distinct signal path with a receiver orientation of φRX = 35◦
yields the highest estimated data rate (cf. Fig. 10a for the
map of the study area). Finally, in Fig. 17c two independent
secondary propagation paths for φT X = −33◦
and φT X = 17◦
are observed. Based on the results in Fig. 17, we conclude
that identifying an independent secondary propagation path
between BS and UE solely based on measured data rates or
signal quality over either AoD or AoA data is very difficult,
as sidelobes may also allow good data rates using the primary
signal path. An approach of combining information from BS,
UE, and external sources such as motion sensors or other
environmental awareness, e.g. [35], [36], may therefore be
needed to identify independent secondary propagation paths
that can be used to overcome blockage which may occur on
the primary path.
V. DISCUSSION
Our mm-wave measurements in a German town center
showed a limited number of 2–4 multipath clusters per receiver
position, which is similar to the results reported for dense
urban areas in modern metropolises [3]–[6]. This stands in
contrast to expectations that the differences in building types

and layout between a typical European town and dense urban
areas in modern metropolises would have an effect on the
number of mm-wave multipath clusters. Our results thus
suggest that it is possible to cover such small cities with
mm-wave Gbps-networks at limited infrastructure cost, as the
area of such city centers is rather small and suitable base
station sites are, thanks to the building structure, easier to
find than in more metropolitan areas. This suggests that mmwave phased antenna arrays and mm-wave massive MIMOtype deployments are an attractive approach to achieve Gbps
data rates in such environments.
However, looking more closely at the structure of the
received multipath clusters, we observe the paradigm shift
that occurs when moving from horn antennas to real phased
antenna arrays. The clusters exhibit a smooth structure when
measured with the horn antenna which has a radiation pattern
without strong sidelobes or nulls, thereby giving a good indication of the actual underlying physical propagation paths. The
same physical propagation paths are perceived very differently
with the phased antenna array: the clusters appear irregular.
This is a consequence of the real phased antenna array which
has a non-ideal radiation pattern with significant sidelobes and
nulls, as shown in Figs. 3c–3d. We also note that such strong
sidelobes in the radiation pattern may result in significant intracell interference, which will have to be carefully considered
during mm-wave network system design. Yet, this fact has
been given only very little attention in the existing literature.
As observed throughout this paper, the antenna radiation
pattern plays a similarly crucial role in the effects of mm-wave
beam misalignment. Our measurements with horn antennas
show a monotonic relationship between misalignment and
loss in received power, as also presented in earlier studies
[6], [12]. By contrast, this does not hold for our phased
antenna array results. For azimuth beam misalignments larger
than the HPBW the degradation of estimated data rate is not
monotonic with increasing beam misalignment for the nonideal, phased antenna array radiation pattern. Instead, it varies
irregularly with increasing beam misalignment. Consequently,
measurement results obtained with horn antennas cannot simply be generalized to also hold for phased antenna arrays when
investigating the effect of beam misalignment on the expected
performance of real mm-wave networks. Similar implications
hold for the theoretical works that make use of simplistic
idealized antenna patterns, e.g. [22], [23].
Our results also showed that a small-scale beam misalignment at one station, i.e. either at BS or UE, caused a significant
loss in estimated data rate that cannot be mitigated fully by
the other station. We expect such a one-sided misalignment
to be particularly harmful in uplink situations. As mm-wave
UEs will likely not be able to feature phased antenna arrays of
the same size as BSs, their antenna gain will be more limited
due to the smaller number of antenna elements. Moreover,
due to the limited battery capacity of the UE, also its output
power will be more limited than the BS’s output power. While
the link performance could still be acceptable under beam
misalignment when the BS transmits with high EIRP, this may
not be the case under beam misalignments in uplink scenarios,
where the UE EIRP is likely to be significantly lower. Thus, we
expect to see a large asymmetry between uplink and downlink
performance in mm-wave networks. Overall, we conclude that
both the BS and UE in mm-wave networks will need to
frequently adjust their orientation to counteract even one-sided
small-scale beam misalignments.
Furthermore, we note that one of the key challenges for enabling mm-wave outdoor networks is the handling of dynamic
blockages by using an independent secondary unblocked signal path, as e.g. pedestrian blockage typically only concerns
one multipath cluster and other multipath clusters remain
unaffected [7]. However, due to the strength of sidelobes
in non-ideal, phased antenna array radiation patterns, our
results suggest that it may be difficult to distinguish between
a true independent secondary propagation path and a link
opportunity due to a sidelobe. This distinction is crucial, as
link opportunities due to sidelobes on the primary propagation
path are also affected by blockage of the primary propagation
path. Beamsteering algorithms that obtain a list of viable
link opportunities based on a simple RSSI search, e.g. IEEE
802.11ad-like algorithms [37], are thus expected to suffer from
this ambiguity if they do not restart at least a partial beam
search upon link blockage.
Finally, our analysis suggest that, despite the wide elevation
HPBW of our phased antenna array of 36◦
, 2D beamsteering
is not sufficient to fully exploit available link opportunities at
certain receiver positions. These results agree with the findings
in [38] where it was demonstrated that 3D rotations can result
15
in strong link degradations. This is particularly relevant as
many beamsteering algorithms proposed in the literature only
consider the planar case [38]. We expect that 3D beamsteering
and hand-grip aware beamcombining [39] will be required to
maintain a high data rate under rotation of the user device
and different user activities. Despite the already increasing
complexity of 5G-and-beyond protocol design, even additional
external information, location-based environmental awareness,
shared beamsteering information from devices in direct vicinity of a UE, or local data from a motion tracking sensor may
further enhance the robustness and seamless coverage of mmwave deployments under user mobility.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
We presented the results of the first comprehensive largescale outdoor mm-wave measurement study using a stateof-the-art phased antenna array in a European town. The
data obtained over more than 5,000 systematic fine-grained
AoA/AoD combinations per TX/RX pair was analyzed with
respect to the number of available link opportunities and the
effect of beam misalignment at the receiver and transmitter
on the estimated mm-wave link data rate, and compared to
reference measurements taken with a horn antenna. Our results
show a limited number of 2–4 available multipath clusters
per receiver location, indicating that the mm-wave multipath
richness in a European town is surprisingly similar to that in
dense urban metropolises as presented in prior literature. The
results for the phased antenna array reveal that losses in the
estimated data rate of up to 70% occurred for small beam
misalignments in the order of the HPBW, with significant
and irregular variations in the estimated data rate for larger
beam misalignments, caused by the non-ideal, phased antenna
array radiation pattern. This stands in stark contrast to the horn
antenna reference measurements, where the loss in estimated
data rate was observed to be monotonically increasing with
the misalignment error. Moreover, our results suggest that the
characteristics of non-ideal, phased antenna array radiation
patterns should be explicitly considered during the design and
testing of mm-wave beamsteering algorithms. To this end, our
ongoing work is focused on conducting further measurements
in more diverse urban scenarios, explicitly studying the performance of beamsteering and beamtracking algorithms based
on data obtained with real mm-wave phased antenna arrays.
