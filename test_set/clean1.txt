2019 marks the year for 5G  which was eventually rolled out for commercial services to consumers  Compared to 4G LTE  5G offers significantly higher bandwidth  lower latency  and better scalability  i e   supporting more devices   The mainstream 5G deployment employs the millimeter wave  mmWave  technology that can provide  in theory  a through put of up to 20 Gbps   a 100  improvement compared to today s 4G  as well as  less than 1ms latency   Under the hood  this is achieved by a series of innovations including massive MIMO  advanced channel coding  and scalable modulation  5G is expected to fuel a wide range of applications that cannot be well supported by 4G  such as ultraHD  UHD  video streaming  networked VR AR  lowlatency cloud gam ing  IoT  and vehicletoeverything  V2X  communication  Despite these potentials  commercial 5G services are at their infancy  In April 2019  Verizon launched 5G in Chicago and Minneapolis  It uses a 400 MHz channel at 28 GHz  making it the world s first commercial mmWave 5G service for con sumers  Most major carriers around the world are rolling out 5G this year or in the process of expanding their footprint to more cities  In this paper  we conduct to our knowledge a first mea surement study of commercial mmWave 5G networks on smartphones  We travel to Verizon  s 5G coverage areas at the two cities and conduct detailed measurements of Verizon  s mmWave 5G networks  We compare the performance of 5G and 4G on key metrics such as throughput  latency  and packet loss rate  Since mmWave signals are vulnerable to ob struction and attenuation  we conduct our experiments under diverse scenarios with different distances orientations be tween the smartphone and the 5GNR  New Radio  panel  and obstruction levels  Furthermore  we study other important aspects such as 4G 5G handoffs  application performance  and many of whose characteristics are quite different from those of 4G  Our twomonth experiments consume 10 TB 5G traffic and 1 TB 4G traffic 1   We summarize our key findings as follows    5G offers much higher throughput than 4G  median through put  1520 vs  147 Mbps   However  even under clear lineof sight  5G throughput exhibits much higher variation than 4G  mainly due to the PHYlayer nature of 5G signals   4 1     Verizon very likely imposes a perTCPconnection throt tling on 5G traffic  This may hurt the performance of single connection protocols such as HTTP 2  Due to its nonstandalone deployment   2   Verizon  s 5G offers little improvement of the endtoend PING RTT over 4G  However  the bufferbloat becomes less severe likely because of 5G s high speed   4 1     5G performance may be affected by obstruction  distance  and devicetower orientation  Among these factors  obstruc tion typically incurs the highest impact  We find that 5G signals can be easily blocked by hands and human body  De spite that  in urban environments  surrounding signal reflec tions can oftentimes mitigate the performance degradation  allowing 5G to function under nonlineofsight   4 2     4G5G handoffs can be triggered by either network con dition change or user traffic  Even under low mobility  e g   walking   a smartphone may experience 31 4G 5G handoffs in less than 8 minutes  Due to the discrepancy between 4G and 5G  frequently switching between them may confuse ap plications  e g   video rate adaptation logic  and bring highly inconsistent user experiences   4 3     For web browsing  5G brings little page load time reduction for most small web pages compared to 4G  For large HTTP S  1 We purchased multiple unlimited 5G data plans from Verizon for this study  Our study conforms to Verizon s wireless customer agreement download  the goodput is significantly lower than the avail able 5G bandwidth  because many crosslayer factors may potentially slow down the download   4 4   At a high level  we find that despite its high throughput  today s 5G has several limitations such as large performance variations  vulnerability to obstructions  and frequent hand offs even during low mobility  We also experimentally show that 5G s high throughput does not always translate to bet ter app QoE  whose improvement requires joint  crosslayer optimizations from multiple players in the mobile ecosystem  We make the following contributions in this paper    We develop practical and sound measurement methodolo gies for mmWave 5G networks on COTS smartphones    We present timely measurement findings of mmWave 5G performance on smartphones with key insights  As our ex periments were conducted when commercial 5G had just made its debut  our results provide an important  baseline  for studying how 5G performance evolves    We intend to release our measurement data to the research community to benefit work that needs real 5G data  2 as crowdsourced measurements of 3G   LTE perfor mance characterization using ISP data   studies of cellular network configurations

have been very recently commercialized  3 MEASUREMENT METHODOLOGY 5G Networks  All our experiments were conducted over Verizon  s 5G network  As of June 2019  Verizon is the only cellular carrier in the U S  that offers commercial mmWave based 5G services to consumers at specific downtown areas in two cities  Minneapolis and Chicago  In both cities  5G coverage areas  dense 5G base stations are deployed  Due to Verizon  s adoption of NSA   2   5G base stations are typi cally colocated with or very close to those of 4G  based on our knowledge and visual inspection   A 5G base station is typically equipped with two panels that are the mmWave transceivers  We observe that the panels typically face popu lated areas such as streets and pedestrian walkways  5G User Equipment  UE   We use two types of COTS 5Gcapable smartphones  Motorola Moto Z3 and Samsung Galaxy S10 5G  SMG977U   henceforth referred to as MZ3 and SGS10  respectively  They are the only two types of commercially available 5G smartphones from Verizon as of midJune 2019  SGS10 has a builtin 5G radio  while MZ3 re quires a separate accessory called 5G Mod  for accessing 5G  Comparing their performance at same locations  we find that MZ3 significantly underperforms SGS10 in terms of 5G throughput  likely due to hardware issues of MZ3 or its 5G mod  To further ensure that our experiments are not affected by device artifacts  we purchase two SGS10 and confirm that they exhibit similar 5G performance  Our experience indi cates the importance of selecting proper devices for studying emerging wireless technologies such as 5G  Thus  unless oth erwise mentioned  all 5G results presented in the paper are from SGS10  We confirm that despite 5G s high throughput  the deviceside processing is not a bottleneck  In some ex periments  we also employ a Samsung Galaxy S9  SGS9  over 4G for 4G5G comparison  We use SGS9 because we are not able to manually switch between 5G and 4G on SGS10  Experiment Sites  We conduct experiments at 4 loca tions  A  B  C  and D   A is a popular downtown area in Minneapolis with many buildings  B is at the boundary of the 5G coverage area in downtown Minneapolis  C is inside a hotel room in downtown Chicago where we stand near an open window  D is near the U S  bank stadium in Minneapolis with large open space  We believe that these 4 locations are representative in terms of their environment  open crowded space  low high surrounding buildings  indoor outdoor  etc    BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK mmWave is an innovative technology integrated into 5G  Unlike 3G 4G that works at  5 GHz  mmWave radios oper ate at much higher frequencies of 30 to 300 GHz  Despite its high bandwidth  mmWave s short wavelength makes its sig nals vulnerable to attenuation  To overcome this  mmWave transceivers have to use phasedarray antennas to form highly directional beams  Due to the pseudooptical nature of a beam  the signals are sensitive to blockages such as a pedestrian or a moving vehicle  Switching from lineofsight  LoS  to nonelineofsight  NLoS  due to blockage may cause significant data rate drop or even complete blackout despite the beamforming algorithm that attempts to  recalibrate  the beams by seeking for a reflective NLoS path   Researchers have demonstrated the feasibility of deploy ing mmWave in data centers   indoor   and outdoor environments   as well as have conducted many studies on beamforming and beam tracking   But none of them studies mmWave in commercial 5G context on smartphones  5G Infrastructure  To reduce the time to market  car riers may couple their 5G core network equipment with existing 4G LTE infrastructures in what is known as a Non Standalone Deployment  NSA   NSA utilizes 5GNR for data plane operations while retaining the 4G infrastructure for control plane operations   NSA is contrasted with a Stan dalone deployment  SA   which is fully independent of legacy cellular infrastructures  Verizon  s 5G uses the NSA model  Measurements of Cellular Networks  There exist a plethora of work on cellular network measurement  such 25G 4G 1 2 4 8 16   of Parallel TCP Connections 2500 2000 1500

TCP performance using 5G  the impact of the environment such as obstruction on 5G  explain 5G handoffs  and finally show the impact of using 5G on application performance  Base 1 2 4 8 16   of Parallel TCP Conn  Figure 1  TCP perf  under LoS   a  throughput   b  RTT  4 1 TCP Performance Under LoS We begin with understanding 5G performance when clear LoS is present  Specifically  we conduct experiments at Lo cations A  B  and C   3   At all locations  we ensure that we can visually see the 5G panel and there is LoS between the phone and the panel  At A and B  we select 5 UEpanel distances from 13m to 75m  we use a laser distance meter  to accurately measure the distance   For each distance  we experiment with 3 orientations  0   45   and 90   see Figure 2   For C  the distance  62m  and orientation  0   are fixed  In each test  we perform TCP bulk download for 60 seconds using  parallel TCP connections  and measure the throughput and RTT every second  reported by iPerf    For all bulk download tests  unless otherwise mentioned  we start collecting data 20 seconds after the TCP flow s  start in order to mitigate the impact of TCP slow start  We repeat the entire process 3 times  All experiments were conducted in clear weather with the phone being held in hand  We believe that the above combinations provide realistic and diverse environmental configurations of urban 5G access from smartphones  In addition  during all experiments  we place next to the SGS10 an SGS9 phone to conduct the same tests over 4G  We confirm that between the two phones  there is no interference that may degrade the performance  The two plots in Figure 1 show the measurement results of throughput and RTT  respectively  for different numbers of concurrent TCP connections  Each boxplot is across all 1second measurement samples for a specific setup  We make several observations  First  5G offers much higher throughput than 4G  With 8 parallel TCP connections  the median 5G and 4G throughputs are 1520 and 147 Mbps  re spectively  However  5G throughput exhibits much higher variations than 4G despite the presence of LoS  This is due to the PHYlayer nature of 5G signals as well as potential inefficiencies at various layers  For example  at PHY MAC layers  smartphones  small form factor makes engineering 5G modem challenging   At the transport layer  an exces sive number of TCP connections may incur crossconnection contentions  Second  5G throughput improves as the TCP concurrency level increases  Through controlled experiments over wired networks and WiFi  we confirm that this is not caused by TCP Server Selection  Due to the ultrahigh bandwidth of 5G  the bottleneck of an endtoend path may easily shift from the wireless hop to the Internet   a situation that seldom appears in 3G 4G  Since the focus of our study is 5G  in most experiments we do not want such a shift to occur  To ensure this  we carefully select a Microsoft Azure server located in the U S  east coast  We justify our selection as follows  First  when downloading data from this server  we get the highest 5G throughput  statistically  compared to servers in other locations or of other cloud providers  Second  when we conduct download test from this server to other hosts  e g   an Amazon cloud instance  over the Internet  we get  3 Gbps throughput  which is much higher than the highest 5G speed we can obtain  during different times of a day  Based on the above observations  we have high confidence that for an end toend path from a UE to our selected server  the Internet is unlikely to become the bottleneck  We also measure how endtoend performance  latency and HTTP download time  is affected by server selection in  4 1 and  4 4  Test Workload  For most of our experiments  we perform large bulk data transfers for bandwidth probing  Specifically  our UE issues one or more TCP connections or a UDP session to download data from an Internet server  Since it is difficult to root our UEs  we run the crosscompiled version of iPerf 3 6  to measure key metrics including throughput  RTT  and packet loss rate  We also experiment with two important applications  web browsing and HTTP S  file download over 5G  with details to be described in  4 4  UEside 5G Monitoring Tool  Due to 5G s very recent debut  we are not aware of any dedicated UEside monitoring tool for it  We therefore develop one that collects the follow ing information to support our measurements   1  the UE s finegrained location   2  all available network interfaces   3  the actively used network interface and its IP address   4  the cell ID  mCID  that the device is connected to   5  the cellular signal strength  and  6  the 5G service status  The above information is obtained from Android APIs  Regarding the last item  the 5G service status   we find that when the UE is connected to 5G  it will be in one of three states   1  the UE is not in 5G coverage area   2  the UE is in 5G area but is connected to 4G due to  for example  poor 5G signals  and 3First Hop East US West US Panel 1 RTT  ms  Total RTT Total RTT 90  5G 27 6 4 54 4 5 81 5 5

across all runs   a  itself  We instead believe that Verizon is imposing perTCP connection rate limiting over 5G  whose bandwidth appears to be fully utilized when there are more than 8 concurrent connections  This practice may hurt the performance of singleconnection protocols such as HTTP 2   Third  regarding the latency  5G and 4G exhibit similar base RTT  i e   endtoend PING  at around 56 ms  To un derstand how much 5G contributes to this RTT  we perform traceroute on the UE to measure the hopbyhop RTT  As shown in Table 1  we find that the first hop RTT  which pre sumably covers the RAN  Radio Access Network   is around 28 ms for both 4G and 5G  accounting for around 50  of the endtoend RTT  Changing the server location to west U S  reduces this fraction to around 33   Overall  likely due to its NSA model that shares much 4G infrastructure with 5G  Verizon  s 5G network provides little improvement of the base RTT over 4G  We expect this to be addressed by the SA model that may achieve the goal of submillisecond RTT  We then consider the RTT during a bulk transfer  As shown in Figure 1 b   4G RTT inflates drastically because of its deep innetwork buffers   Bufferbloat in 5G is much less severe  likely due to the fast 5G speed that drains the buffer much faster than 4G  Also  5G exhibits low packet loss rates  50   75   99  percentiles  0 01   0 1   1 2    We also study UDP over 5G  Since UDP does not provide congestion control  we manually increase the sending rate exponentially from 512 Kbps to 2 Gbps  we find that for sending rates up to 1 Gbps  the receiverside loss rate is close to 0  This indicates 5G s compatibility with UDPbased protocols such as QUIC  and HTTP 3  at these low to medium data rates  However  at our test locations  Verizon  s 5G is not able to reliably sustain 2 Gbps or a higher sending rate over UDP  as we observe a packet loss rate of up to 17  at 2 Gbps  4 2 750 500 250 0 human 20 human 2000 1000  b  0 Handoffs 4G 5G 5G

times and observe qualitatively similar results  with one representative run illustrated in Figure 3 a   As shown  both obstructions trigger 5Gto4G handoffs and lead to significant performance degradation  In contrast  when experimenting with 4G  neither blockage incurs noticeable throughput drop  figure not shown   due to the lowfrequency bands used by 4G signals  The above results show that it is difficult for 5G signals to penetrate a hand or human body  causing NLoS between the transmitter and receiver  We then study other types of obstructions using similar methods  We find that when the UE is inside a backpack  a cardboard box  or a clear glass  5G signals can penetrate these containers  experimented with  less than 100 meters distance to the 5G panel with LoS   However  5G signals can hardly penetrate human body  trains  pillar structures  and tinted glass  We find that 5G works in vehicles since the front windshield is typically clear glass  However  when the vehicle is moving  mobilityincurred handoffs may considerably degrade 5G performance   4 3   We next repeat the same experiment in Location A  also using a human body and a hand as obstructions  As shown in Figure 3 b   the impact of the obstructions becomes smaller  the 5G connectivity persists despite a fair amount of per formance degradation  Figures 3 a  and  b  indicate that the environment can affect the impact of obstructions  At Location A  despite the NLoS created by the obstructions  the nearby buildings can reflect signals and create multiple paths  and the reflected signal can still reach the UE  At Lo cation C  the room has UVprotective windows that are very common in today s buildings  Since the windows attenuate reflected 5G signals   multipath becomes ineffective  In other words  the only effective signal propagation path is through the open window  Blocking it inevitably degrades the performance  Impact of the Environment Obstruction and NLoS Performance  The experiments in  4 1 assume a clear LoS path without any obstruction  We now place different types of objects along the LoS path to test whether 5G signals can penetrate bypass them  We first exemplify two most common obstructions  human body and hand  We stay at Location C  the Chicago hotel room  with an open window through which the phone has LoS to the 40  45  90  Orientation Angle     Figure 4

to that at 25m  We attribute this to the clear LoS and sufficiently high transmis sion power of 5G antennas  For a single TCP connection  no noticeable throughput drop is observed because of the bandwidth underutilization  Overall  among all factors  obstruction  orientation  and distance   obstruction typically incurs the highest impact on 5G performance  Fortunately  in urban environments  surrounding signal reflections can oftentimes mitigate the performance degradation  allowing 5G to function under NLoS  1 conn  8 conn  25 50 75 100 160 Dist  b  UE   5Gpanel  meters  Figure 5  Impact of UEpanel distance on throughput  Impact of UEpanel Orientation  We also investigate how the UE s orientation to the panel affects network per formance  We define the orientation as the minimum angle between the LoS and all normal vectors of the base station s panels  As illustrated in Figure 2  an orientation of 0  is pre ferred because the panel is directly facing the UE  while an orientation of 90  is the least ideal case  Our orientation test is performed at Location D where we can find a large LoS area centered by a 5G tower  We pick three spots whose ori entations are 0   45   and 90   All spots have a 25m distance to the tower  At each spot  we perform three 60second bulk download tests using 8 parallel connections  As shown in the  w o SS  boxes in Figure 4  the default setting of performing 60second transfers excluding the slow start   we observe very small performance difference between 0  and 45  orien tation  likely attributed to the environmental reflection and beamforming  However  in the extreme case where the orien tation becomes 90   we do observe a median throughput drop of 40   The  w  SS  boxes correspond to short  25second  measurements from the very beginning of TCP connection establishment  They follow a similar trend except that when TCP slow start is considered  the throughput becomes lower  Impact of UEPanel Distance  We study how the dis tance between a UE and the panel affects network perfor mance  We conduct the experiment at Location B  where we select five spots with their distances to the panel being 25m  50m  75m  100m  and 160m  respectively  The panel and the five spots are on the same line  At each spot  we conduct three 60second bulk download tests using 1 and 8 parallel TCP connection s   During all tests  we ensure that the UE is always associated with the same panel  i e   there is no 5G4G or 5G5G handoff   4 3   Our test location  B  makes this easy  recall that B is at the boundary of Minneapolis  5G coverage area  we can therefore increase the UEpanel distance by moving the UE away from the coverage area without worrying the UE connecting to a different panel  Achieving this inside the 5G coverage area is more difficult due to the dense deployment of 5G base stations  We find that at Location D  near the stadium   the phone can also reliably connect to the same panel at a long distance  So we conduct our test there as well  4 3 Handoffs in 5G Handoffs in 5G differ from those in 4G 3G in both the hori zontal and vertical dimensions  A Horizontal Handoff  HH  occurs when a UE s association switches from one panel  in 5G s term  to another  In 5G  HHs may frequently occur due to the smaller coverage of 5G panels compared to 4G tow ers  A Vertical Handoff  VH  is triggered when the wireless technology changes  e g   5G to 4G   VHs are also prevalent in 5G whose signals are more unstable than 4G  Handoffs in 5G are more frequent than 4G due to small coverage of 5G base stations and the instability of 5G signals  5G handoffs are also more complex as they involve switching between 4G and 5G subsystems  We closely examine Verizon  s handoff mechanisms  In 5G NSA  a UE may be in one of the three states   1  the UE is connected to 5G   2  the UE is in 5G coverage area but is connected to 4G due to  for example  poor 5G signals  and  3  the UE is not in 5G area  We refer to these states as C  Connected to 5G   R  Ready for 5G but not yet connected   and O  outside 5G coverage   respectively  and we identify them by our monitoring tool  We use this state and the cell ID field  also collected by our tool  to track both HH and VH  Note that in 5G  cell IDs identify 5GNR panels  We then conduct experiments in both cities under various mobility levels  stationary  rotating  walking  and driving  to capture the above data related to handoffs  We identify 4 types of primitive handoffs  P1 to P4  as listed in the upper part of Table 2  P1 and P2 are VHs because there are handoffs between 4G and 5G  When a UE s 5G signal strength drops  e g   due to an NLoS obstruction   P1 is triggered to down grade the connectivity from 5G to 4G  when the network condition improves  the connectivity will be restored back to 5G  P2   Note that in the 5Gready  R  mode  the UE actually connects to a 4G radio that is on the same tower  where the 5GNR panel resides  or a nearby tower  but the cell ID does 5Description VH  5G 4G  same cellID VH  4G 5G  same cellID VH HH  5G 4G  diff cellID HH  4G 4G  diff cellID Sequence C1 R1 R1 C1 C1 R2 R1 R2 Type P1 P2 P3 P4 10 7 4 1 Description

Walking a 700m loop in downtown region  Figure 6  5G throughput and handoffs under low mobility  not change  This is likely because of NSA where 4G and 5G are deeply coupled  At the R state  the UE is still closely mon itoring the original 5G panel for a possible 4G to 5G upgrade  P3 is similar to P1 except that the 5G to 4G downgrade ends at a different cell ID  panel   P4 is a 4G to 4G HH from one cell ID to another  We do not observe a C1 C2 or R1 C2 sequence in our data  This is likely because NSA uses 4G for controlplane signaling   the UE will always first associate with the new cell s 4G radio for control message exchanges before establishing the 5G data channel  Interestingly  we also find that the  in activity of user traffic can trigger 4G5G handoffs  A P1 handoff will occur when there is an inactivity of user traffic for  10 seconds  at the R state  any user traffic will restore the 5G connectivity through a P2 handoff  if the 5G signal is good  The rationale of such trafficguided handoffs is possibly to reduce the 5G standby time that may consume additional energy  From our data  we observe that oftentimes the primitive handoffs form complex sequences that we call combinational handoff sequences  We identify them by clustering primi tive handoffs using an interval threshold  set to 10 seconds   They are exemplified at the bottom part of Table 2 as O1 to O5  These combinational sequences correspond to highlevel events that can not be realized by a single primitive handoff  For example  O3 represents a 5Gto5G handoff that consists of three primitive handoffs  a 5G to 4G VH on the old panel  a 4G to 4G HH from the old to new panel  and a 4G to 5G VH on the new panel  The whole procedure takes several seconds to finish  We next show a case study to demonstrate the impact of handoffs  In this experiment  one of the authors holds a phone while walking at a normal speed   5 km h  at Loca tion A for about 8 minutes  The phone keeps downloading data from a server over 8 parallel connections  Figure 6 plots the throughput  cellular connectivity  4G 5G   and hand offs  During this 8minute walk  the phone experiences 31 primitive handoffs and bounces between 4G and 5G for 13 times  Such frequent switches make the throughput highly fluctuating  ranging from 0 to 954 Mbps  This may confuse applications  e g   video rate adaptation logic   and bring highly inconsistent user experiences  The above results highlight the need for crosslayer efforts that improve 5G performance under  even low  mobility  Some directions for example include PHY MAC enhancements for reducing the handoff frequency  and robust upperlayer solutions that can adapt to frequent 4G 5G handoffs  such as MPTCP  and prefetching   4 4 Application Performance Web Browsing  We develop a WebViewbased browser and use it to programmatically load the landing pages of 9 pop ular websites listed in Figure 7 over 5G and 4G  We then compare their page loading time  PLT   We conduct the ex periments at Locations A and C with SGS10  5G  and SGS9  4G   In order to make a fair comparison  we confirm that both devices yield statistically similar PLT when loading diverse web pages locally  In Location A  C   the UEpanel distance is 50m  62m  with LoS  For each site  We use an automated script to perform coldcache loading  i e   with an empty web cache  over 5G and 4G backtoback  and re peat this for 30 times  As shown in Figure 7  for most sites with small page sizes    3 MB   4G and 5G achieve similar PLT  This is attributed to two reasons  First  web brows ing requires a synergy between network transfer and local processing  with the latter oftentimes being the bottleneck in particular for small web pages   Second  as we load the pages from the original content providers  the bottle neck may shift from the wireless hop to the Internet  For large pages  FoxNews and CNN   loading them over 5G does shorten the median PLT by 17 5  and 23 6   respectively  because of the reduction of the content fetch time  6GoogleCDN VDMSCDN CloudfrontCDN AkamaiCDN AzureCDN AWSWest AzureEast AWSEast AzureWest plan to explore them in our future work  Finally  we did

and Oliver Spatscheck  2013  An indepth study of LTE  effect of network protocol and application servers over 5G  HTTP S  Download  We investigate the HTTP S  down load performance  We upload a 1GB file to geographically distributed public cloud instances and CDN servers 2   We then develop a custom HTTP S  client that issues 8 parallel byterange requests each fetching 1 8 of the file over 5G  The experiments are conducted at Locations A and C  clear LoS with a UEpanel distance of 30m for A and 62m for C  0  ori entation   For each server  we repeat the file download for 3 times at both locations  and measure the average throughput  The results are shown in Figure 8  We find that all cloud CDN servers exhibit low throughput compared to the iPerf through put shown in Figure 1 a   the average throughput ranges from 119 to 730 Mbps with a median of 222 Mbps across all servers  The somewhat surprising results make us realize that HTTP S  download is very different from iPerf bandwidth probing  Multiple factors may slow down HTTP S  down load  such as the HTTP request latency  TCP slow start  DNS time  Internetside bottleneck link  serverside data process ing  e g   HTTP chunked mode and HTTP 2 multiplexing   HTTPS encryption decryption  unbalanced byterange ses sions  some sessions may finish earlier than others    to name a few  Although these factors already exist in 3G 4G eras  they are amplified in 5G due to its high speed  The above results indicate that 5G s high throughput does not always translate to better app QoE  whose improvement requires joint  crosslayer optimizations from multiple sources  5 CONCLUDING REMARKS Our study on the world s first commercial mmWave 5G net work quantitatively reveal 5G performance on COTS smart phones to the community  Our study identifies key research directions on improving 5G users  experience in a crosslayer manner  For example  how to design 5Gfriendly transport protocols  How to strategically select interface s  among 5G  4G  and WiFi  What type of support should a mobile OS provide for enhancing QoE over 5G  Meanwhile  we admit that this short paper leaves many interesting measurement questions unanswered  such as 5G video streaming perfor mance  interaction between 5G and various TCP congestion control schemes  and detailed 5G radio energy models  We 2 We do not use the CDN servers to perform most measurements in early sections because we could not run iPerf on these servers  7behavior on performance  In ACM SIGCOMM   Junxian Huang  Qiang Xu  Birjodh Tiwana  Z Morley Mao  Ming
