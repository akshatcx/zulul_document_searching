Abstract—In this paper we address the problem of resource
allocation for alarm traffic in industrial Internet of Things
networks using massive MIMO. We formulate the general
problem of how to allocate pilot signals to alarm traffic such
that delivery is guaranteed, while also minimising the number of
pilots reserved for alarms, thus maximising the channel resources
available for other traffic, such as industrial control traffic. We
present an algorithm that fulfils these requirements, and evaluate
its performance both analytically and through a simulation
study. For realistic alarm traffic characteristics, on average our
algorithm can deliver alarms within two time slots (of duration
equal to the 5G transmission time interval) using fewer than 1.5
pilots per slot, and even in the worst case it uses around 3.5
pilots in any given slot, with delivery guaranteed in an average
of approximately four slots.
