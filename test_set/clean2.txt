Multiantenna technologies are the key enabler for unlocking the potential of millimeterwave  mmwave  spectrum bands in 5Gandbeyond networks     A number of mmwave outdoor measurement campaigns  predominantly using channel sounder setups with horn antennas  e g     have now demonstrated the fundamental feasibility of mmwave links in urban environments and resulted in mmwave statistical channel models  see  and references therein   This year has also seen the first test commercial mmwave outdoor deployments  albeit with limited capabilities and performance   Directional highgain antenna beams are used to overcome the high path loss at mmwave frequencies  but the sensitivity to misalignment of antenna beams    and the effect of link blockage due to environmental and mobile obstacles such as buildings  and humans   remain primary challenges for seamless coverage in largescale mobile network deployments  The key to making mmwave All authors are with the Institute for

precise beamsteering to overcome effects of blockage and beam misalignment caused by large and smallscale mobility  and provide seamless gigabitpersecond  Gbps  connectivity  Great advances have been reported in the literature regarding mmwave antenna technology    but the evaluation of these devices has been largely conducted in controlled indoor environments  The notable exceptions to this are    which demonstrated outdoor coverage measurements using mmwave phased antenna arrays  However  these works lack finegrained angleofarrival  AoA  and angleofdeparture  AoD  measurements  which are crucial for understanding the impact of beam misalignment on mmwave link and network performance  Other prior outdoor measurement studies  e g     used horn antenna or omnidirectional antenna setups  The existing literature thus offers very limited insight on the performance of mmwave antenna arrays in a real outdoor urban network environment  in particular with respect to the beamsteering opportunities and beam misalignment effects  which is an essential input for systemlevel engineering design of future mmwave networks  In this paper  we present the first largescale outdoor urban mmwave measurement study using a stateoftheart phased antenna array  collecting received signal strength  RSS  data over systematic finegrained 3D AoA and AoD orientations in a typical European town  We study the impact of phased antenna arrays in terms of the number of link opportunities  achievable data rate and robustness under smallscale mobility  and directly compare this against reference measurements using a horn antenna  Our results show a limited number of 2 4 available distinct spatial link opportunities per receiver location  indicating that the mmwave multipath richness in a typical European town center is surprisingly similar to that in dense urban areas as presented in        The results for the phased antenna array reveal that losses in estimated data rate of up to 70  occur for small beam misalignments in the order of the halfpower beamwidth  HPBW   with significant and irregular variations in estimated data rate for larger beam misalignments due to the nonideal phased antenna array radiation pattern  By contrast  the loss in estimated data rate for the horn antenna setup is monotonically increasing with the orientation error  This shows that earlier measurement studies    or theoretical studies    of beam misalignment effects on mmwave link and network performance using horn antennas or idealized directional antenna patterns cannot be arXiv 1909

rest of the paper is organized as follows  Sec  II gives the related work overview  Sec  III presents our measurement setup and methodology  Our measurement results are presented and analyzed in Sec  IV  In Sec  V we discuss the engineering implication of our findings for outdoor mmwave network deployments  Finally  Sec  VI concludes the paper  II  RELATED WORK Recent years have seen great advances in mmwave phased antenna arrays and corresponding transceivers for base stations  BSs  and user equipment  UE   For instance  Samsung  has presented a 28 GHz base station with a 64element phased antenna array  IBM and Ericsson  have demonstrated a dualpolarized 28 GHz phased antenna array module with 128 elements  and Sivers IMA has released 16element mmwave phased antenna array   However  these new mmwave transceivers and phased antenna array designs have largely been evaluated in controlled environments    rather than in real outdoor urban settings  Notable exceptions to this are the studies in    In     and  data rate measurements with 28 GHz multi antenna arrays were conducted in outdoor environments  analyzing the possible coverage in potential mmwave cells  Yet  these studies did not include detailed AoA or AoD measurements  which are central to understanding the impact of nonideal  mmwave phased antenna arrays on the design of beamsteering algorithms for mmwave networks  In  the RSS over AoD was measured at several receiver positions in a car park using an omnidirectional antenna at the receiver and a 60 GHz phased antenna array at the transmitter side  finding strong reflected paths for many receiver positions  However   did not investigate beamsteering opportunities and limitations caused by beam misalignment  due to the lack of AoA data  By contrast  in this work we present the results of the first comprehensive largescale urban measurement campaign with mmwave phased antenna arrays systematically collecting RSS over finegrained AoA and AoD antenna orientations  Independently from the advances in mmwave multiantenna technology  a number of mmwave measurement campaigns have been conducted in outdoor environments with the aim of establishing statistical mmwave channel models  see  and references therein   Rappaport et al   conducted seminal measurements at 28  38  60 and 70 GHz in Austin  Texas  and New York City using a sliding correlator channel sounder with mechanically steerable horn antennas to record the power delay profile for a limited selected range of AoA and AoD combinations at each TX RX pair  Similar measurement methodologies have been employed in other measurement campaigns  e g         and measurementbased statistical channel models such as the NYU model  have consequently been proposed  see  and references therein   Overall  analyzing the number of potential link opportunities  the studies in       reported a limited number of 2 5 mmwave multipath clusters per TX RX pair for urban areas in different metropolises  However  as these measurements campaigns were conducted with horn or omnidirectional antenna setups  they do not allow us to study the impact of phased antenna arrays on potential link opportunities and beam misalignment in mmwave networks  By contrast  in this work we collected RSS data with mmwave phased antenna arrays over finegrained AoA and AoD sample points to study these open questions  Additionally  we conducted measurements in a typical European town rather than a big city like prior studies in the literature  Lee et al   studied the effect of beam misalignment based on measurements taken with a channel sounder and horn antennas  To that end  power measurements were systematically collected across azimuth angles at 28 and 38 GHz in both freespace and urban environments  The general conclusion based on these horn antenna measurements was that for a fixed beamwidth  the power loss increases linearly with increasing beam misalignment until saturation is reached  This confirms the results of Simic  et al  in   where the RSS over AoA and AoD was systematically measured with a horn antenna setup in an urban environment in the 60 GHz band  The results in    stand in stark contrast to the results of our phased antenna array measurements in this paper  which show a nonlinear relationship between misalignment and power loss  To demonstrate that this is caused by the nonideal  phased antenna array pattern  we also explicitly compare our measurements against those with a horn antenna in the same outdoor scenarios  Our comparison underlines the paradigm shift that occurs in terms of beam misalignment effects when moving from horn antennas to real phased antenna arrays  In addition to empirical research  the effect of beam misalignment on mmwave network performance has also been addressed from a theoretical perspective  e g  in     These approaches typically make use of simple and idealized antenna radiation pattern models to investigate the effect of fundamental antenna parameters such as beamwidth on various metrics of system performance  Moreover  analyses regarding beam misalignments have mainly focused on misalignments smaller than the main lobe beamwidth   Wildman et al   do consider larger beam misalignments from a theoretical perspective and show that in theory sidelobes can be beneficial to the success probability of a transmission in low density networks and that the spatial throughput and transmission capacity maximizing beamwidth has a nearly linear relationship with the mean orientation error for Gaussian and sectored antenna radiation pattern models  As such idealized radiation pattern models are much more similar to a horn antenna radiation pattern than that of a real mmwave phased antenna array  our results strongly suggest that such a linear relationship will not hold in real mmwave deployments and that the severe consequences of this idealization on the requirements and opportunities of beamsteering algorithms and network system design have been underestimated  Therefore  our work forms a basis for realistic models of beam misalignment effects in urban 5Gandbeyond mmwave networks  3 Transmitter position RX C Receiver position RX B RX A RX D TX 1 TX 2 B D Fig  1  Aerial view of the TX  12  and RX positions  AD   with the initial antenna

German town of Langenfeld  The measurement area constitutes the central pedestrian zone with mainly shops in the surroundings and only delivery trucks being allowed to enter  The buildings typically have 25 floors and are constructed of concrete with large windows and some metal parts on the facades  The measurements were conducted over the course of 12 days during the summer of 2018  with dry weather and temperatures of around 25  C  The transmitter  TX  was located at different positions on the rooftop of a multifloor car park at a height of 9 7 m  The receiver  RX  positions A D were located in the pedestrian zone  i e  on ground level  with the mounted antenna at a height of 1 7 m  Fig  1 shows an aerial image of the area where the TX positions  1  2  and RX positions  A  B  C  D  are marked  Fig  2 shows the different TX and RX positions during the measurements  The RX is circled in green and the TX in orange  In case the LOS is blocked  a green square indicates the geometric LOS direction  The positions were chosen based on representative scenarios as follows    TX1RXA  Typical scenario for small cell  with clear LOS and TXRX distance of 25 m  Figs  2a2b     TX1RXB and TX2RXB  RXB was chosen to investigate the effects of an obstructed LOS and evaluate the coverage from different TX positions for the same RX position  In scenario TX1RXB the LOS is partially blocked by a building corner  while in scenario TX2RXB the LOS is partially blocked by a lamppost with a flower box mounted on it  Figs  2c2f     TX1RXC  Represents a typical street canyon with 18 m width and buildings to the left and to the right  The large TXRX distance of 65 m makes this representative of celledge distances in a mmwave small cell  The LOS path was predominantly clear despite tree foliage  Figs  2g2h     TX2RXD  Scenario chosen to investigate the effect of tree foliage on mmwave coverage  with a TXRX distance of 28 m and clearly visible trees obstructing the LOS  Figs  2i  2j   For our measurement campaign we used two different 60 GHz transceiver setups  one utilizing a phased antenna array and the other utilizing a standard horn antenna for comparison  A relatively narrowband signal transmission was chosen  1 MHz  to obtain finegrained RSS and angle orientation data  allowing us to have a robust setup that does not require strict calibration as the gain over the frequency band is flat and the timecomponent of the channel is not recorded  Importantly  since we are not interested in a timecharacterization of the channel  the narrowband power measurements are sufficient for our objective of characterizing mmwave link opportunities in a typical outdoor environment and beamsteering requirements for maintaining a reliable link connectivity under smallscale mobility  Both setups utilize softwaredefined radios  SDRs   facilitating transport and use in different locations  We note that the frequency bands in the range of 24 86 GHz are under consideration for 5Gandbeyond mmwave cellular networks   In this paper  we report measurements in the 60 GHz band without the loss of generality  due to equipment availability and for comparability with prior mmwave outdoor urban measurement studies  e g          A  Phased Antenna Array Setup We used the SiversIMA 60 GHz phased antenna array radio frequency integrated circuit  RFIC  TRX BF 01  with the corresponding evaluation kit EVK06002   The setup is capable of operating in the frequency range from 57 GHz  71 GHz  The included RF module uses direct conversion in both TX and RX mode  It includes a 16 16  TX RX  patch antenna module  with each antenna array consisting of 16 2 microstrip patch antenna elements directly connected to the RFIC   Fig  3a shows a schematic drawing of the phased antenna array board and the RFIC  The phase weights and amplitudes are applied to the signal in the analog RF domain using 16 independent RF paths  Thus  only azimuth plane beamsteering is allowed in the range   based on a codebook with up to 64 different antenna pattern entries  The phased array transceiver was controlled via a USB interface  Figs  3c3d compare the measured phased antenna array

generates a complex sinusoidal signal at the frequency fsin   250 kHz and streams it to the USRP  The USRP generates a baseband signal with a sampling rate fs   1 MHz which is fed to the phased antenna array transceiver  The phased antenna array transceiver upconverts the signal to a frequency fc   58 32 GHz  and transmits the signal over the air  The RX phased antenna array downconverts the received signal and feeds it to the USRP  which samples the signal with a sampling rate fs   1 MHz  The complex samples are streamed to the host PC 2  where the power spectrum of the received signal is computed using a flattop window  Finally  the signal strength RSSA meas of the received sinusoidal signal is extracted from the power spectrum  which was calibrated against an Agilent E4440A spectrum analyzer  B  Horn Antenna Setup For comparison  our second setup used the FC1005V 00 Vband converter by SiversIMA  and a standard 15 dBi gain horn antenna by Flann Microwave   The FC1005V 00 is capable of up and downconverting to and from 5766 GHz using an intermediate frequency  IF  bandwidth of 15 GHz  Fig  3b shows the simulated radiation pattern of the standard gain horn antenna  The

antenna array setup  cf  Sec  IIIA   except that the signal between the USRP and up downconverter is at the intermediate frequeny fIF   1 32 GHz and not at baseband  The RSS at the horn antenna setup

 AoA   we systematically swept the angular space by changing the beam orientations at the TX and RX  Each beam orientation can be characterized by a pair of azimuth and elevation angles  φ  θ   As the phased antenna array transceiver only allows beamsteering in a 90  azimuth range and the horn antenna setup cannot electronically steer its beam  we have used a custom made 3D turntable to help cover the complete angular space with additional mechanical movements when the range of electronic beamsteering was exceeded  The turntable uses two stepper motors for azimuth and elevation movement  The automated 3D turntable with the mounted phased antenna array transceiver is shown in Fig  6a  1  Phased Antenna Array Transceiver  For the measurements  we covered all orientations within azimuth φRX
