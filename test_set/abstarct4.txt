This study attempts to understand the use of Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) in practice to obtain
insights to develop design interventions that bring the CPGs into the Internet of Things. Our ultimate
aim is to equip CPGs with a layer of smartness so that CPGs could collect information about their use
and provide extra services and functionalities. With a practice perspective we developed an assemblage
of methods to analyze and represent how people use CPGs. We chose cooking as our practice case
and use an autoethnographic data sample to demonstrate the application of our methods. Despite
the early stage of our study, our methods provide ways to get an understanding of how CPGs are
used in practice and an opening to establish opportunities for design interventions
