abstract—exploiting multi-antenna technologies robust beamsteering overcome effects blockage beam misalignment key providing seamless multi-gbps connectivity 5g-and-beyond mm-wave networks paper present first large-scale outdoor mm-wave measurement study using phased antenna array typical european town systematically collect fine-grained 3d angle-of-arrival angleof-departure data totaling 50,000 received signal strength measurements study impact phased antenna arrays terms number link opportunities achievable data rate robustness small-scale mobility compare this against reference horn antenna measurements results show a limited number 2–4 link opportunities per receiver location indicating mm-wave multipath richness a european town surprisingly similar dense urban metropolises the results the phased antenna array reveal significant losses estimated data rate occur beam misalignments the order the half-power beamwidth significant irregular variations larger misalignments contrast the loss the horn antenna monotonically increasing the misalignment results strongly suggest that the effect non-ideal phased antenna arrays must explicitly considered the design agile beamsteering algorithms index terms—millimeter wave phased antenna array beam misalignment multipath propagation urban deployments
