Abstract  We conduct to our knowledge a first measurement study of commercial mmWave 5G performance on smartphones by closely examining 5G networks in two U S  cities  We conduct extensive field tests on 5G performance under diverse conditions including different obstruction levels  phonetower distances  and device orientations  We systematically analyze the handoff mechanisms in 5G and their impact on network performance  We also study app performance  web browsing and HTTP download  over 5G  and how Internet server selection affects the endtoend performance for 5G users  Our experiments consume 10 TB of 5G data  conducted when 5G just made its debut in April 2019  These experiments provide a  baseline  for studying how 5G performance evolves  and identify key research directions on improving 5G users  experience in a crosslayer manner
