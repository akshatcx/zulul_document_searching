Mental well-being technologies possess many qualities that give them the potential to help people
receive assessment and treatment who may otherwise not receive help due to fear of stigma or lack of
resources. The combination of advances in sensors, microcontrollers and machine learning is leading
to the emergence of dedicated tangible interfaces to monitor and promote positive mental well-being.
However, there are key technical, ergonomic and aesthetic challenges to be overcome in order to
make these interfaces effective and respond to usersâ€™ needs. In this paper, the barriers to develop
mental well-being tangible interfaces are discussed by identifying and examining the recent
technological challenges machine learning, sensors, microcontrollers and batteries create.
