    We expect that there are two files present in the directory named "fulltext.csv" and "summaries.csv". 

Project Description:

    We went for a rule based approach. As we are considering only the cases regarding papers/websites/documents where we assume that the
    content is without much sarcasm and humour. Because of that we can neglect some part of the context and focus on accuracy which is
    better in rule based approach. We are focusing on many points like Named Entity Recognition, Stemming and Synonyms. We used BM-25
    which was able to tell us a relevance score for each word in our query. We changed the weight of synonyms and NER accordingly
    so that we get the optimum result.
