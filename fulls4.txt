arise window window limited time defined two reasons first set alarms may occur change time example factory floor reconfigured second time scale alarms need served may very different reset example alarm may triggered upon malfunction given machine necessitating machine shut quickly however time repair machine may much longer machine nonoperational longer possible alarm triggered window therefore interval time set possible alarms constant alarm ∈ probability p be triggered slot triggered alarm be triggered within window reality alarm trigger probabilities could be correlated begin assuming independent alarms simplify analysis consider correlated alarms future work triggered alarm also deadline number slots within must be successfully received base station given alarm successful first transmission attempt example collision attempt retransmission deadline according pilot allocation scheme assume alarm messages short enough be transmitted within single slot d. pilot allocation problem problem define pilot allocation scheme guarantees delivery alarms within deadlines naive strategy could be simply assign one pilot alarm every slot would certainly guarantee alarm delivery would be very inefficient since probability alarm triggered very low let alone given slot moreover many possible alarms may be enough pilots slot uniquely assign one alarm source goal therefore be minimise number pilots need be assigned alarms still guaranteeing delivery formally define pilot allocation scheme finite sequence pilots defined each alarm source given alarm source alarm triggered begins transmitting alarm message next slot using first pilot its pilot sequence collision attempts retransmission following slot using second pilot its sequence alarm source know there collision fail receive acknowledgement base station downlink phase coherence block transmits upon collisions alarm source proceeds along sequence one slot time reaches end its final retransmission attempt pilot sequence may also contain blank pilots indicating alarm source remains silent corresponding slot instead attempting retransmission collision occurs base station optionally transmit pilot offset alarm sources involved collision using multicast transmission described section ii-a case alarm sources add pilot offset next value pilot sequences example alarm ∈ pilot 1 its next allocated pilot alarm b ∈ pilot 2 its next pilot base station transmits pilot offset 10 alarm transmit using pilot 11 next slot b transmit using pilot 12 pilot offset thus allows dynamic pilot allocation base station still fixed pre-determined sequences each alarm source see section iii simplify collision resolution since each collision be resolved its pilot range parallel any new alarm transmissions sufficient condition guarantee alarm delivery within deadline each pilot sequence be longer number slots alarm triggering its deadline last pilot each alarm ’ sequence be unique across set alarms alarm source unique pilot allocated given slot be able transmit its alarm message without any risk collision thus guaranteeing delivery slot since there reason continue retransmission collision-free transmission

using collision trees section present efficient pilot allocation algorithm guarantee alarm delivery algorithm based concept call collision trees method assigning pilot sequences alarms alarms lower trigger probabilities longer sequences share pilots other alarms more often shared pilots entail risk collision least two alarms sharing pilot triggered same time therefore beneficial lower probability alarms share pilots more higher fig 1 example pilot allocation alarm transmission collision resolution collision 1 four pilots allocated following slot collision resolution this resolve alarms collision two pilots allocated next slot collision resolved similarly collision 2 requires first four pilots two finally one third slot following initial transmission probability alarms authors

alarm transmissions alarm sources without requiring prior grant channel access best case alarms triggered window arrive different slots pilots need be allocated them each transmit without collision common pilot event collision however resolve collision its isolated pilot range facilitated base station transmitting pilot offset involved alarm sources this allows us consider only alarms involved collision ignore any alarms arrive collision resolution these will be sent using common pilot necessary undergo collision resolution separate pilot range affecting original collision resolution process this somewhat reduces efficiency collision resolution however it greatly simplifies design pilot allocation scheme allows us more easily guarantee alarm delivery example pilot allocation collision resolution shown figure 1 collision occurred involved alarm sources attempt retransmission according their predefined pilot sequences see section ii-d design these sequences will use collision trees inspired trees used create huffman codes collision tree equal v e constructed follows begin set alarms together their trigger probabilities p ∈ each alarm will become leaf collision tree combine two alarms lowest probabilities making them children parent node also probability associated it namely probability least one its children alarms triggered repeat procedure combining two nodes lowest probabilities do yet parent nodes making them children newly created parent node fig 2 example collision tree five alarm sources leaf nodes representing alarms shown grey each node ’ probability shown it pilot assigned each node shown blue its right probability new node given probability least one alarms its child subtree triggered this process continues iterate finally left single node which will become root node tree whose probability equal the probability any alarm triggered given slot given node v ∈ v the tree the probability least one the alarms its subtree triggered given π v equal 1 − l∈l v 1 − π l 1 l v the set leaf nodes descended v π l l ∈ v leaf node the tree equal the probability the associated alarm triggered π l equal p l l ∈ the alarm associated leaf node l ∈ v. the tree has constructed need assign pilots each node the tree each level the tree represents one time slot the collision resolution process nodes the tree must be assigned pilots unique within their level this feasible long the number nodes any level does exceed the total number pilots available each time slot assign pilots simply label the nodes each level pilot numbers starting 1 increasing the number nodes the level the root the tree assigned the common pilot initial alarm transmissions determine the pilot sequence given alarm then read order the pilots assigned each node the path the root the leaf node corresponding the alarm example collision tree shown figure 2 five alarms a1 a5 trigger probabilities p a1 equal 0.6 p a2 equal 0.35 p a3 equal 0.3 p a4 equal 0.15 p a5 equal 0.15 first a4 a5 combined since the lowest trigger probabilities placed children new node v4 the probability v4 given π v4 equal 1 − 1 − 0.15 1 − 0.15 equal 0.278 the next two orphan nodes nodes without parent the lowest probabilities then a2 a3 which placed the children new node v3 probability 1 − 1 − 0.3 1 − 0.35 equal 0.545 the two orphan nodes the lowest probabilities v3 v4 so they placed the children new node v2 probability 1 − 1 − 0.35 1 − 0.3 1 − 0.15 1 − 0.15 equal 0.671 finally only two orphan nodes remaining so they placed the children the new root node v1 probability 0.869 which the probability least one the alarms triggering the resulting collision tree has four levels corresponding maximum four slots needed resolve alarms the maximum number pilots would need be reserved any slot four slot t 3 t the slot which the alarms first transmitted b performance analysis there two key performance metrics interest assessing the quality given pilot allocation scheme the first the delivery time the alarms the second the expected number pilots reserved alarms these then be used control traffic the delivery time be considered each individual alarm the entire set alarms taking aggregate measures across the set the maximum delivery time any given alarm given simply the length its pilot sequence collision tree-based allocation this equivalently the length the path the leaf node associated the alarm the root the tree can express this dˆ equal |r l dˆ a the maximum delivery time alarm a ∈ a time slots l a ∈ v the leaf node the tree associated alarm a r v v ∈ v the path a node v the root the tree consisting the parent node v followed the parent node v ’ parent so the root node the maximum delivery time can be used determine whether alarm a can be guaranteed delivery within its deadline dˆ a less equal the number time slots a ’ deadline then delivery within the deadline ensured default our collision tree algorithm guarantees delivery alarms not necessarily within their deadlines however checking the maximum delivery time each alarm its deadline the tree can easily be modified ensure all alarms meet their deadlines albeit some loss performance this can be done moving alarm node l a up the tree along r l a dˆ a within the deadline first l a moved up one level become a sibling its parent its grandparent node its new parent the deadline still not met this procedure repeated so l a next becomes a sibling its grandparent then its great-grandparent so needed addition the maximum delivery time the expected delivery time each alarm also important even though the deadline represents the absolute latest time alarm can be delivered not all delivery times within the deadline necessarily equal it may be beneficial deliver the alarm sooner rather later our collision tree algorithm seeks minimise the probability alarm will use its entire pilot sequence order be delivered so the expected delivery time will be significantly shorter the maximum note delivery time analogous codeword length huffman codes its analysis more complicated alarms do not always use their full pilot sequence the expected delivery time each alarm general not equal its maximum delivery time since huffman codes optimal terms encoded message length our collision trees will also be optimal terms maximum delivery times alarms not necessarily terms expected delivery time more analysis needed prove disprove this result will be the subject our future work the expected delivery time alarm a ∈ a depends the collision probabilities each node r ∈ r l a — the probability a collision occurring the pilot assigned node r its slot this probability given c v equal 1 − x l∈l v π l m∈l v 1 − π − l∈l v 1 − π l 2 the complement the probability either none the alarms sharing the pilot assigned v triggered only one them soon two or more alarms transmit a collision will occur however determining the expected delivery time a given alarm a specific alarm must have been triggered so need find the conditional collision probability given a triggered this case it sufficient any one the other alarms also covered v be triggered so the conditional probability a collision v given a triggered c v a equal 1 − m∈l v 1 − π 3 the expected delivery time alarm a then given e equal 1 x r∈r l a c r a 4 a the random variable representing the delivery time alarm a v0 the root node the tree the minimum delivery time always one slot representing the case the alarm delivered straight away without collision the event a collision an additional slot then added each node along the path r l a which there a collision note a collision at node v ∈ v also implies a collision at all nodes along r v the collision probability at any leaf node 0 finally order obtain an aggregate performance metric across all alarms can take the average delivery time across the alarms d equal 1 |a| x a∈a e 5 our second performance consideration the effect our pilot allocation scheme the control traffic terms the total expected number pilots reserved alarm traffic per slot including pilots allocated collision resolution however calculating the expected number reserved pilots our alarm traffic model is not straightforward since an alarm is triggered it can no longer be triggered it is thus removed the set possible alarms consequently the probability a collision will be lower subsequent slots meaning the expected number reserved pilots each slot will reduce monotonically move the time window alarms triggered calculate the expectation all slots would therefore need consider all possible combinations which alarms could trigger the same slots which order which is not feasible do practice will therefore take a performance measure the a priori expected number pilots reserved per slot that is the expected number pilots needed alarms per slot assuming all alarms can be triggered this will give an upper bound the true expectation alarms can only be triggered the a priori expected number pilots reserved alarm traffic is given eˆ equal 1 x v∈v\ c r v 6 eˆ denotes the a priori expectation defined p is the random variable representing the number pilots reserved alarm traffic per slot r v v ∈ v is the parent node v. one pilot is needed each node whose parent node has a collision an additional pilot the root node the common pilot reserved all blocks alarms the two performance metrics discussed do not take account the effect alarms removed the set possible alarms they have been triggered so will overestimate the real performance however they provide an indication the worst case performance no alarms have yet been triggered so assist dimensioning the network these metrics provide a means compare different collision trees produced either the algorithm given section iii or others example these metrics could be used optimise the collision tree which intend explore our future work iv simulation study order empirically test the performance the collision tree algorithm

conclusion this paper we have studied a new problem in urllc traffic in 5g networks that of massive mimo pilot allocation alarm traffic in industrial internet of things scenarios in particular factory process automation we have presented a grant-free random access scheme alarm traffic together with an algorithm for pilot collision resolution that can guarantee alarm delivery while making efficient use of pilot resources in our future work we plan to further investigate the performance alarm deadlines are shorter than their initial assigned pilot sequence length necessitating moving some alarms further up the collision tree we also aim to find optimal collision trees compare them with generated using our algorithm as well as compare the performance of collision trees with other contention resolution methods other possible directions for future work include modelling simulation of control traffic as well as studying different traffic distributions for alarms correlation alarm
